This single-page website converts text/transcript into a coloured map of the emotions of the content.

Colours are mapped onto Plutchnik's 'Wheel of emotion' - for psychologists, Plutchnik's Wheel is perhaps the most established map of emotions.

>  The text (large transcripts give the best results), is typed or pasted into a textbox by the user
>  The code makes a frequency count of the words in the text
>  The code then matches these words against a pre-indexed list of 1000 common English words. Each word has been pre-indexed to a particular emotion.
>  The code then draws semi-transparent circles inside the diagram, with the circle size representing a word's frequency in the text
>  The user gets to see the emotional tone of the transcript as they type/paste

Future Improvements :
>  Only just over 1000 common English words have been indexed to an emotion. This should be increased to several thousand ideally.
>  The choice of emotion that's mapped to each word needs to be validated by several people (currently only one person has allocated which emotion a word best links to)
>  The severity of each word-emotion mapping needs to factored in. For example 'adore' is stronger than 'like', and should have more weighting in circle size or colour tone.
>  Some words should be applied to multiple emotions, eg. 'worry' can be mapped to both the 'Anticipation' side of the Wheel, but can also be mapped to 'Fear' at the opposite side of the wheel.
>  Some English words are inherently ambiguous, eg. 'beat' or 'long' or 'sling' - but this is a broader problem not yet fully solved by even advanced AI language-processing technology
