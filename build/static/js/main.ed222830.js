Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evilGalactic Empire.During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plansto the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armoredspace station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia raceshome aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans thatcan save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a totaleclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tinysilver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursedby a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadlylaserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causingthe main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.1 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY 1An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their waythrough the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots areold and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. Hisface is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot ofhuman proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallicsurface of an Art Deco design.Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.THREEPIODid you hear that? They've shutdown the main reactor. We'll bedestroyed for sure. This ismadness!Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions inthe main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)We're doomed!The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds thatonly another robot could understand.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)There'll be no escape for thePrincess this time.Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts asloud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavyequipment are heard moving around the outside hull of theship.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)What's that?2 EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE 2The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel BlockadeRunner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into theunderside dock of the giant Imperial starship.3 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER 3The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly atremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway anda score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers maketheir way into the smoke-filled corridor.In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze withlaserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patternscreating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duckbehind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebelsoldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holdingshattered arms and faces.An explosion hits near the robots.THREEPIOI should have known better than totrust the logic of a half-sizedthermocapsulary dehousingassister...Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle ragesaround the two hapless robots.4 EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY 4A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lonefigure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirationswho looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggyhair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple butlovable lad with a prize-winning smile.2.A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on alarge battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of thedesert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aidedby a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robotappears to be barely functioning and moves with jerkymotions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke'seye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinocularsfrom his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a fewmoments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented,crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport thattravels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). Hemotions for the tiny robot to follow him.LUKEHurry up! Come with me! What areyou waiting for?! Get in gear!The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, andsmoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws hisarms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumpsinto his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hummadly.5 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY 5The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes hisway into the blinding light of the main passageway. This isDarth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscuredby his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, whichstands out next to the fascist white armored suits of theImperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs awayfrom the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps throughthe Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and runin a frenzied panic.6 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER 6A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.Artoo makes beeping sounds.7 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER 7Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo isnowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebelsoldiers can be heard in the distance.THREEPIOArtoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention andhe spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smokefilled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen yearsold) stands in front of Artoo.3.Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in thesmoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computerface, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)At last! Where have you been?Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)They're heading in this direction.What are we going to do? We'll besent to the spice mine of Kessel orsmashed into who knows what!Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down thesubhallway. Threepio chases after him.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Wait a minute, where are you going?Artoo responds with electronic beeps.8 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR 8The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twistedbodies of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by theneck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.IMPERIAL OFFICERThe Death Star plans are not in themain computer.Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who strugglesin vain.VADERWhere are those transmissions youintercepted?Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.VADER (CONT\u2019D)What have you done with thoseplans?REBEL OFFICERWe intercepted no transmissions.Aaah... This is a consular ship.Were on a diplomatic mission.VADERIf this is a consular ship... wereis the Ambassador?4.The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as theDark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating agruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns tohis troops.VADER (CONT\u2019D)Commander, tear this ship apartuntil you've found those plans andbring me the Ambassador. I want heralive!The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.9 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY 9The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as thestormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess LeiaOrgana, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in hereyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing soundsof the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of thetroopers spots her.TROOPERThere she is! Set for stun!Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper withher laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by aparalyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.TROOPER (CONT\u2019D)She'll be all right. Inform LordVader we have a prisoner.10 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY 10Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod.He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning lightbegins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way intothe cramped four-man pod.THREEPIOHey, you're not permitted in there.It's restricted. You'll bedeactivated for sure..Artoo beeps something to him.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Don't call me a mindlessphilosopher, you overweight glob ofgrease! Now come out beforesomebody sees you.5.Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regardingthe mission he is about to perform.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Secret mission? What plans? Whatare you talking about? I'm notgetting in there!Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beepsand twangs angrily.A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debristhrough the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lankyrobot jumps into the lifepod.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)I'm going to regret this.11 INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER 11On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the twoterrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebelspacecraft.CHIEF PILOTThere goes another one.CAPTAINHold your fire. There are no lifeforms. It must have been shortcircuited.12 INT. LIFEPOD 12Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperialstarship. Stars circle as the pod rotates through thegalaxy.THREEPIOThat's funny, the damage doesn'tlook as bad from out here.Artoo beeps an assuring response.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Are you sure this things safe?13 EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY13Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached whitebuildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dustyempty street of the tiny settlement.6.An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speedingvehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past.WOMANI've told you kids to slow down!14 INT. POWER STATION - DAY 14Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, arugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who hasbeen asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races throughthe office, yelling wildly.FIXERDid I hear a young noise blastthrough here?CAMIEIt was just wormie on anotherrampage.Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deakand Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, areplaying a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashycity attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunicsof the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in thebackground.LUKEShape it up you guys!... Biggs?Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way togreat joy and emotion. They give each other a great bearhug.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)I didn't know you were back! Whendid you get in?BIGGSJust now. I wanted to surprise you,hot shot. I thought you'd behere... certainly didn't expect youto be out working.(he laughs)LUKEThe Academy didn't change youmuch...but you're back so soon?Hey, what happened, didn't you getyour commission?Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.7.BIGGSOf course I got it. Signed aboardThe Rand Ecliptic last week. Firstmate Biggs Darklighter at yourservice...(he salutes)...I just came to say good-bye toall you unfortunate landlockedsimpletons.Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashingfriend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snapsout of it.LUKEI almost forgot. There's a battlegoing on! Right here in our system.Come and look!DEAKNot again! Forget it.15 EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION -15DAYThe group stumbles out into thestifling desert sun. Camie and TheFixer complain and are forced toshade their eyes. Luke has hisbinoculars out scanning theheavens.LUKEThere they are!Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain tosee something with the naked eye. Through the binocularsBiggs sees two small silver specks.BIGGSThat's no battle, hot shot...they're just sitting there!Probably a freighter-tankerrefueling.LUKEBut there was a lot of firingearlier...Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against thebuilding in the process. Luke grabs them.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)Hey, easy with those...8.CAMIEDon't worry about it, Wormie.The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boyshrugs his shoulders in resignation.FIXERI keep telling you, the Rebellionis a long way from here. I doubt ifthe Empire would even fight to keepthis system. Believe me Luke, thisplanet is a big hunk of nothing...Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. Thegroup stumbles back into the power station, grumbling aboutLuke's ineptitude.16 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY 16Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squadof armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she isbrutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with thebriskly marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway asDarth Vader emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lordstares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn'tmove.LEIALord Vader, I should have known.Only you could be so bold. TheImperial Senate will not sit forthis, when they hear you'veattacked a diplomatic...VADERDon't play games with me, YourHighness. You weren't on any mercymission this time.

I'm a member of the ImperialSenate on a diplomatic mission toAlderaan...VADERYou're a part of the RebelAlliance... and a traitor. Take heraway!9.Leia is marched away down the hallway and into thesmoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An ImperialCommander turns to Vader.COMMANDERHolding her is dangerous. If wordof this gets out, it could generatesympathy for the Rebellion in thesenate.VADERI have traced the Rebel spies toher. Now she is my only link tofind their secret base!COMMANDERShe'll die before she tells youanything.VADERLeave that to me. Send a distresssignal and then inform the senatethat all aboard were killed!Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.They stop and snap to attention.SECOND OFFICERLord Vader, the battle stationplans are not aboard this ship! Andno transmissions were made. Anescape pod was jettisoned duringthe fighting, but no life formswere aboard.Vader turns to the Commander.VADERShe must have hidden the plans inthe escape pod. Send a detachmentdown to retrieve them. See to itpersonally, Commander. There'll beno one to stop us this time.COMMANDERYes, sir.17 EXT. SPACE 17The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of theplanet Tatooine.10.18 EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT 18Jundland, or \"No Man's Land\", where the rugged desert mesasmeet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droidskick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod andclumsily work their way across the desert wasteland. Thelifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand.THREEPIOHow did I get into this mess? Ireally don't know how. We seem tobe made to suffer. It's our lot inlife.Artoo answers with beeping sounds.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)I've got to rest before I fallapart. My joints are almost frozen.Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)What a desolate place this is.Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and startsoff in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepiostops and yells at him.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Where are you going?A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the smallrobot.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Well, I'm not going that way. It'smuch too rocky. This way is mucheasier.Artoo counters with a long whistle.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)What makes you think there aresettlements over there?Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Don't get technical with me.Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.11.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)What mission? What are you talkingabout? I've had just about enoughof you! Go that way! You'll bemalfunctioning within a day, younearsighted scrap pile!Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in thedirection of the vast dune sea.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)And don't let me catch youfollowing me begging for help,because you won't get it.Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudgesoff in the direction of the towering mesas.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)No more adventures. I'm not goingthat way.Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward thedistant mountains.19 EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA 19Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of adune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on forendless miles. He looks back in the direction of the nowdistant rock mesas.THREEPIOThat malfunctioning little twerp.This is all his fault! He trickedme into going this way, but he'lldo no better.In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sandfrom his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint ofreflected light in the distance reveals an object movingtowards him.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Wait, what's that? A transport! I'msaved!The bronze android waves frantically and yells at theapproaching transport.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Over here! Help! Please, help!12.20 EXT.

I shouldn't tellyou this, but you're the only one Ican trust... and if I don't comeback, I want somebody to know.Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.13.LUKEWhat are you talking about?BIGGSI made some friends at the Academy.(he whispers)...when our frigate goes to one ofthe central systems, we're going tojump ship and join the Alliance...Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.LUKEJoin the Rebellion?! Are youkidding! How?BIGGSQuiet down will ya! You got a mouthbigger than a meteor crater!LUKEI'm sorry. I'm quiet.(he whispers)Listen how quiet I am. You canbarely hear me...Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.BIGGSMy friend has a friend on Bestinewho might help us make contact.LUKEYou're crazy! You could wanderaround forever trying to find them.BIGGSI know it's a long shot, but if Idon't find them I'll do what I canon my own... It's what we alwaystalked about. Luke, I'm not goingto wait for the Empire to draft meinto service. The Rebellion isspreading and I want to be on theright side -- the side I believein.LUKEAnd I'm stuck here...BIGGSI thought you were going to theAcademy next term. You'll get yourchance to get off this rock.14.LUKENot likely! I had to cancel myapplication. There has been a lotof unrest among the Sandpeoplesince you left... they've evenraided the outskirts of Anchorhead.BIGGSYour uncle could hold off a wholecolony of Sandpeople with oneblaster.LUKEI know, but he's got enoughvaporators going to make the placepay off. He needs me for just onemore season. I can't leave him now.BIGGSI feel for you, Luke, you're goingto have to learn what seems to beimportant or what really isimportant. What good is all youruncle's work if it's taken over bythe Empire?... You know they'restarting to nationalize commerce inthe central systems... it won't belong before your uncle is merely atenant, slaving for the greaterglory of the Empire.LUKEIt couldn't happen here. You saidit yourself. The Empire won'tbother with this rock.BIGGSThings always change.LUKEI wish I was going... Are you goingto be around long?BIGGSNo, I'm leaving in the morning...LUKEThen I guess I won't see you.BIGGSMaybe someday... I'll keep alookout.15.LUKEWell, I'll be at the Academy nextseason... after that who knows. Iwon't be drafted into the ImperialStarfleet that's for sure... Takecare of yourself, you'll always bethe best friend I've got.BIGGSSo long, Luke.Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards thepower station.21 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET 21The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strangeforeboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthlycreatures fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through thecreepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clickingnoise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic soundand stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continueson his way.In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon walland a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A littlefurther up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals apair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from thenarrow path.The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail untilsuddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots outof the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He managesone short electronic squeak before he topples over onto hisback. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, thenoff again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no tallerthan Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as theycautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks andtheir faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can beseen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heavethe heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off downthe trail.22 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET 22The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tanklike vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld asmall disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under alarge tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robotis sucked into the giant machine.The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small laddersand enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.16.23 INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA 23It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artooswitches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumblesaround the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rustymetal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted andmaimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronicwhimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door atthe end of the chamber.24 INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA 24Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In themiddle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of variousshapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronicconversation, while others simply mill about. A voice ofrecognition calls out from the gloom.THREEPIOArtoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.25 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET 25The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificenttwin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountainridge.26 EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY 26Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the halfburied lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine.A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.FIRST TROOPERSomeone was in the pod. The tracksgo off in this direction.A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sandand gives it to the first trooper.SECOND TROOPERLook, sir -- droids.27 EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES 27The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.28 INT. SANDCRAWLER 28Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the crampedprison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.17.THREEPIOWake up! Wake up!Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computerlights pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of thelong chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber withblinding white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their waythrough the odd assortment of robots.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)We're doomed.A Jawa starts moving toward them.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Do you think they'll melt us down?Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will thisnever end?29 EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON 29The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up theirbattered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front ofthe enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a smallhomestead consisting of three large holes in the groundsurrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one smalladobe block house.The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots,straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dentedmetallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smellhorribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas whentheir mouths and nostrils should be.Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars,a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes aresunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefullyinspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slumpshouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile littleJawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated salespitch in a queer, unintelligible language.A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form thehomestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Berustanding in the main courtyard.18.BERULuke, tell Owen that if he gets atranslator to be sure it speaksBocce.LUKEIt looks like we don't have much ofa choice but I'll remind him.Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipmentfor sale with the Jawa leader.OWENI have no need for a protocoldroid.THREEPIO(quickly)Sir -- not in an environment suchas this -- that's why I've alsobeen programmed for over thirtysecondary functions that...OWENWhat I really need is a droid thatunderstands the binary language ofmoisture vaporators.THREEPIOVaporators! Sir -- My first job wasprogramming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators.You could say...OWENDo you speak Bocce?THREEPIOOf course I can, sir. It's like asecond language for me... I'm asfluent in Bocce...OWENAll right shut up!(turning to Jawa)I'll take this one.THREEPIOShutting up, sir.OWENLuke, take these two over to thegarage, will you?(MORE)19.I want you to have both of themcleaned up before dinner.LUKEBut I was going into Toshi Stationto pick up some power converters...OWENYou can waste time with yourfriends when your chores are done.Now come on, get to it!LUKEAll right, come on! And the redone, come on. Well, come on, Red,let's go.As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots backinto the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beepand starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrainedby a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the tworobots start off for the garage when a plate pops off thehead of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparkswildly.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)Uncle Owen...OWENYeah?LUKEThis R2 unit has a bad motivator.Look!OWEN(to the head Jawa)Hey, what're you trying to push onus?The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo hassneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying toattract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepiotaps Luke on the shoulder.THREEPIO(pointing to Artoo)Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit isin prime condition. A real bargain.LUKEUncle Owen...OWEN (CONT'D)20.OWENYeah?LUKEWhat about that one?OWEN(to Jawa)What about that blue one? We'lltake that one.With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades thedamaged astro-droid for Artoo.LUKEYeah, take it away.THREEPIOUh, I'm quite sure you'll be verypleased with that one, sir. Hereally is in first-class condition.I've worked with him before. Herehe comes.Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robotstrudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.LUKEOkay, let's go.THREEPIO(to Artoo)Now, don't you forget this! Why Ishould stick my neck out for you isquite beyond my capacity!30 INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON 30The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peacefulatmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowershimself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near thebattered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large batterywith a cord to his face.THREEPIOThank the maker! This oil bath isgoing to feel so good. I've gotsuch a bad case of dustcontamination, I can barely move!21.Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost inthought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a smalltwo-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off thegarage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of himand he slams a wrench across the workbench.LUKEIt just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs isright. I'm never gonna get out ofhere!THREEPIOIs there anything I might do tohelp?Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his angerdrains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.LUKEWell, not unless you can altertime, speed up the harvest, orteleport me off this rock!THREEPIOI don't think so, sir. I'm only adroid and not very knowledgeableabout such things. Not on thisplanet, anyways. As a matter offact, I'm not even sure whichplanet I'm on.LUKEWell, if there's a bright center tothe universe, you're on the planetthat it's farthest from.THREEPIOI see, sir.LUKEUh, you can call me Luke.THREEPIOI see, sir Luke.LUKE(laughing)Just Luke.THREEPIOAnd I am See-Threepio, human-cyborgrelations, and this is mycounterpart, Artoo-Detoo.22.LUKEHello.Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins toscrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chromepick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wipingoil from his bronze body.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)You got a lot of carbon scoringhere. It looks like you boys haveseen a lot of action.THREEPIOWith all we've been through,sometimes I'm amazed we're in asgood condition as we are, what withthe Rebellion and all.LUKEYou know of the Rebellion againstthe Empire?THREEPIOThat's how we came to be in yourservice, if you take my meaning,sir.LUKEHave you been in many battles?THREEPIOSeveral, I think. Actually, there'snot much to tell. I'm not much morethan an interpreter, and not verygood at telling stories. Well, notat making them interesting,anyways.Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo'sneck joint. He uses a larger pick.LUKEWell, my little friend, you've gotsomething jammed in here real good.Were you on a cruiser or...The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumblinghead over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch threedimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator,being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image isa rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimlylit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.23.LEIAHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're myonly hope.LUKEWhat's this?Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer forThreepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentencefragment over and over.THREEPIOWhat is what?!? He asked you aquestion...(pointing to Leia)What is that?Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just noticethe hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answerfor Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat thesentence fragment over and over.LEIAHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're myonly hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.You're my only hope.THREEPIOOh, he says it's nothing, sir.Merely a malfunction. Old data. Payit no mind.Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.LUKEWho is she? She's beautiful.THREEPIOI'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.LEIAHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...THREEPIOI think she was a passenger on ourlast voyage. A person of someimportance, sir -- I believe. Ourcaptain was attached to...LUKEIs there more to this recording?Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several franticsqueaks and a whistle.24.THREEPIOBehave yourself, Artoo. You'regoing to get us in trouble. It'sall right, you can trust him. He'sour new master.Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)He says he's the property of ObiWan Kenobi, a resident of theseparts. And it's a private messagefor him. Quite frankly, sir I don'tknow what he's talking about. Ourlast master was Captain Antilles,but with what we've been through,this little R2 unit has become abit eccentric.LUKEObi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if hemeans old Ben Kenobi?THREEPIOI beg your pardon, sir, but do youknow what he's talking about?LUKEWell, I don't know anyone named ObiWan, but old Ben lives out beyondthe dune sea. He's kind of astrange old hermit.Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a fewmoments.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)I wonder who she is. It sounds likeshe's in trouble. I'd better playback the whole thing.Artoo beeps something to Threepio.THREEPIOHe says the restraining bolt hasshort circuited his recordingsystem. He suggests that if youremove the bolt, he might be ableto play back the entire recording.Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess andhasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.25.LUKEH'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you'retoo small to run away on me if Itake this off! Okay.Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt offArtoo's side.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)There you go.The princess immediately disappears...LUKE (CONT\u2019D)Well, wait a minute. Where'd shego? Bring her back! Play back theentire message.Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up inembarrassment.THREEPIOWhat message? The one you'recarrying inside your rusty innards!A women's voice calls out from another room.AUNT BERULuke? Luke! Come to dinner!Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioningrobot.LUKEAll right, I'll be right there,Aunt Beru.THREEPIOI'm sorry, sir, but he appears tohave picked up a slight flutter.Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench andhurries out of the room.LUKEWell, see what you can do with him.I'll be right back.THREEPIO(to Artoo)Just you reconsider playing thatmessage for him.Artoo beeps in response.26.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)No, I don't think he likes you atall.Artoo beeps.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)No, I don't like you either.31 INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA 31Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcherwith blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the wellused kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowlsof food and starts for the dining area.Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered withsteaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of redgrain.LUKEYou know, I think that R2 unit webought might have been stolen.OWENWhat makes you think that?LUKEWell, I stumbled across a recordingwhile I was cleaning him. He sayshe belongs to someone called ObiWan Kenobi.Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, butmanages to control himself.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)I thought he might have meant oldBen. Do you know what he's talkingabout? Well, I wonder if he'srelated to Ben.Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.OWENThat old man's just a crazy oldwizard. Tomorrow I want you to takethat R2 unit into Anchorhead andhave its memory flushed. That'll bethe end of it. It belongs to usnow.27.LUKEBut what if this Obi-Wan comeslooking for him?OWENHe won't, I don't think he existsany more. He died about the sametime as your father.LUKEHe knew my father?OWENI told you to forget it. Your onlyconcern is to prepare the newdroids for tomorrow. In the morningI want them on the south ridgeworking out those condensers.LUKEYes, sir. I think those new droidsare going to work out fine. Infact, I, uh, was also thinkingabout our agreement about mystaying on another season. And ifthese new droids do work out, Iwant to transmit my application tothe Academy this year.Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppressit.OWENYou mean the next semester beforeharvest?LUKESure, there're more than enoughdroids.OWENHarvest is when I need you themost. Only one more season. Thisyear we'll make enough on theharvest so I'll be able to hiresome more hands. And then you cango to the Academy next year.Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at hisuncle.OWEN (CONT\u2019D)You must understand I need youhere, Luke.28.LUKEBut it's a whole 'nother year.OWENLook, it's only one more season.Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.LUKEYeah, that's what you said lastyear when Biggs and Tank left.AUNT BERUWhere are you going?LUKEIt looks like I'm going nowhere. Ihave to finish cleaning thosedroids.Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owenmechanically finishes his dinner.AUNT BERUOwen, he can't stay here forever.Most of his friends have gone. Itmeans so much to him.OWENI'll make it up to him next year. Ipromise.AUNT BERULuke's just not a farmer, Owen. Hehas too much of his father in him.OWENThat's what I'm afraid of.32 EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD 32The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind adistant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a fewmoments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to thehomestead.33 INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE 33Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere insight. He takes a small control box from his utility beltsimilar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates thebox, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out ashort yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.29.LUKEWhat are you doing hiding there?Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere insight.THREEPIOIt wasn't my fault, sir. Pleasedon't deactivate me. I told him notto go, but he's faulty,malfunctioning; kept babbling onabout his mission.LUKEOh, no!Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.34 EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD 34Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homesteadand searches the darkening horizon for the small tripedastro- robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and onthe salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with hiselectrobinoculars.THREEPIOThat R2 unit has always been aproblem. These astro-droids aregetting quite out of hand. Even Ican't understand their logic attimes.LUKEHow could I be so stupid? He'snowhere in sight. Blast it!THREEPIOPardon me, sir, but couldn't we goafter him?LUKEIt's too dangerous with all theSandpeople around. We'll have towait until morning.Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.OWENLuke, I'm shutting the power downfor the night.30.LUKEAll right, I'll be there in a fewminutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.He takes one final look across the dim horizon.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)You know that little droid is goingto cause me a lot of trouble.THREEPIOOh, he excels at that, sir.35 INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA 35Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis ofthe open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling ofUncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.OWENLuke? Luke? Luke? Where could he beloafing now!36 INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN 36The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beruprepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.OWENHave you seen Luke this morning?AUNT BERUHe said he had some things to dobefore he started today, so he leftearly.OWENUh? Did he take those two newdroids with him?AUNT BERUI think so.OWENWell, he'd better have those unitsin the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!37 EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY 37The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepiopilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vastwasteland.31.38 INT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING -38DAYLuke leans over the back of thespeeder and adjusts something inthe motor compartment.LUKE(yelling)How's that.Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into thewind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)Old Ben Kenobi lives out in thisdirection somewhere, but I don'tsee how that R2 unit could havecome this far. We must have missedhim. Uncle Owen isn't going to takethis very well.THREEPIOSir, would it help if you told himit was my fault.LUKE(brightening)Sure. He needs you. He'd probablyonly deactivate you for a day orso...THREEPIODeactivate! Well, on the other handif you hadn't removed hisrestraining bolt...LUKEWait, there's something dead aheadon the scanner. It looks like ourdroid... hit the accelerator.39 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY 39From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seengliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foregroundtwo weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desertcloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of themarginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifleand points it at the speeder but the second creature grabsthe gun before it can be fired.32.The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimescalled, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get intoan animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to getin the final word and the nomads scurry over the rockyterrain.40 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON 40The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tiedto a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as largeas elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns,and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raidersmount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backsand ride off down the rugged bluff.41 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR 41The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon.Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder,stands before little Artoo.LUKEHey, whoa, just where do you thinkyou're going?The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio posesmenacingly behind the little runaway.THREEPIOMaster Luke here is your rightfulowner. We'll have no more of thisObi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... anddon't talk to me about yourmission, either. You're fortunatehe doesn't blast you into a millionpieces right here.LUKEWell, come on. It's getting late. Ionly hope we can get back beforeUncle Owen really blows up.THREEPIOIf you don't mind my saying so,sir, I think you should deactivatethe little fugitive until you'vegotten him back to your workshop.LUKENo, he's not going to try anything.Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass offrantic whistles and screams.33.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)What's wrong with him now?THREEPIOOh my... sir, he says there areseveral creatures approaching fromthe southeast.Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.LUKESandpeople! Or worst! Come on,let's have a look. Come on.42 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY 42Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge andscans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots thetwo riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind theyoung adventurer.LUKEThere are two Banthas down therebut I don't see any... wait asecond, they're Sandpeople allright. I can see one of them now.Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through hiselectrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front ofhis field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, alarge, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio isstartled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. Hecan be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs andrattles down the side of the mountain.The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointedgaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror inthe heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to blockthe blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces.The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forcedto the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider standsover him with his weapon raised and lets out a horribleshrieking laugh.43 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY 43Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove inthe rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying theinert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before thespeeder. The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing partsand supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Theneverything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moanis heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends theSandpeople fleeing in terror.34.Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slightswishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows evencloser, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears andleans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked andweathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetratingeyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyesas he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes aslight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.BENHello there! Come here my littlefriend. Don't be afraid.Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap andbegins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand onLuke's forehead and he begins to come around.BEN (CONT\u2019D)Don't worry, he'll be all right.LUKEWhat happened?BENRest easy, son, you've had a busyday. You're fortunate you're stillin one piece.LUKEBen? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad tosee you!BENThe Jundland wastes are not to betraveled lightly. Tell me youngLuke, what brings you out this far?LUKEOh, this little droid! I think he'ssearching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in adroid before... there seems to beno stopping him. He claims to bethe property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.Is he a relative of yours? Do youknow who he's talking about?Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.BENObi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Nowthats a name I haven't heard in along time... a long time.35.LUKEI think my uncle knew him. He saidhe was dead.BENOh, he's not dead, not... not yet.LUKEYou know him!BENWell of course, of course I knowhim. He's me! I haven't gone by thename Obi-Wan since oh, before youwere born.LUKEThen the droid does belong to you.BENDon't seem to remember ever owninga droid. Very interesting...He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.BEN (CONT\u2019D)I think we better get indoors. TheSandpeople are easily startled butthey will soon be back and ingreater numbers.Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a patheticbeep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.LUKEThreepio!44 EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY 44Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit andbegins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps.Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepiolying half buried in the sand. One of his arms has brokenoff.Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and thenflips a hidden switch on his back several times untilfinally the mechanical man's systems turn on.THREEPIOWhere am I? I must have taken a badstep...36.LUKECan you stand? We've got to get outof here before the Sandpeoplereturn.THREEPIOI don't think I can make it. You goon, Master Luke.

KENOBI'S DWELLING 45The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk butstill manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort andsecurity.

Hedidn't hold with your father'sideals. Thought he should havestayed here and not gotteninvolved.LUKEYou fought in the Clone Wars?BENYes, I was once a Jedi Knight thesame as your father.LUKEI wish I'd known him.37.BENHe was the best star-pilot in thegalaxy, and a cunning warrior. Iunderstand you've become quite agood pilot yourself. And he was agood friend. Which reminds me...Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. AsLuke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit therestraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on thetable. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handlewith several electronic gadgets attached to it.BEN (CONT\u2019D)I have something here for you. Yourfather wanted you to have this whenyou were old enough, but your unclewouldn't allow it. He feared youmight follow old Obi-Wan on somedamned-fool idealistic crusade likeyour father did.THREEPIOSir, if you'll not be needing me,I'll close down for awhile.LUKESure, go ahead.Ben hands Luke the saber.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)What is it?BENYour fathers lightsaber. This isthe weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not asclumsy or as random as a blaster.Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots outabout four feet and flickers there. The light plays acrossthe ceiling.BEN (CONT\u2019D)An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time. For over a thousandgenerations the Jedi Knights werethe guardians of peace and justicein the Old Republic. Before thedark times, before the Empire.Luke hasn't really been listening.38.LUKEHow did my father die?BENA young Jedi named Darth Vader, whowas a pupil of mine until he turnedto evil, helped the Empire huntdown and destroy the Jedi Knights.He betrayed and murdered yourfather. Now the Jedi are all butextinct. Vader was seduced by thedark side of the Force.LUKEThe Force?BENWell, the Force is what gives aJedi his power. It's an energyfield created by all living things.It surrounds us and penetrates us.It binds the galaxy together.Artoo makes beeping sounds.BEN (CONT\u2019D)Now, let's see if we can't figureout what you are, my little friend.And where you come from.LUKEI saw part of the message he was...Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautifulyoung Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.BENI seem to have found it.Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickersbefore his eyes.LEIAGeneral Kenobi, years ago youserved my father in the Clone Wars.Now he begs you to help him in hisstruggle against the Empire. Iregret that I am unable to presentmy father's request to you inperson, but my ship has fallenunder attack and I'm afraid mymission to bring you to Alderaanhas failed.(MORE)39.I have placed information vital tothe survival of the Rebellion intothe memory systems of this R2 unit.My father will know how to retrieveit. You must see this droid safelydelivered to him on Alderaan. Thisis our most desperate hour. Helpme, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my onlyhope.There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffson a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in hiseyes.BENYou must learn the ways of theForce if you're to come with me toAlderaan.LUKE(laughing)Alderaan? I'm not going toAlderaan. I've got to go home. It'slate, I'm in for it as it is.BENI need your help, Luke. She needsyour help. I'm getting too old forthis sort of thing.LUKEI can't get involved! I've got workto do! It's not that I like theEmpire. I hate it! But there'snothing I can do about it rightnow. It's such a long way fromhere.BENThat's your uncle talking.LUKE(sighing)Oh, God, my uncle.

He is followed by his powerfulally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals standand bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takeshis place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord standsbehind him.TARKINThe Imperial Senate will no longerbe of any concern to us.

Vader, release him!VADERAs you wish.TARKINThis bickering is pointless. LordVader will provide us with thelocation of the Rebel fortress bythe time this station isoperational.

It's just...I never heard of them hittinganything this big before.Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.BENThey didn't. But we are meant tothink they did. These tracks areside by side. Sandpeople alwaysride single file to hide therenumbers.LUKEThese are the same Jawas that soldus Artoo and Threepio.BENAnd these blast points, tooaccurate for Sandpeople. OnlyImperial stormtroopers are soprecise.LUKEWhy would Imperial troops want toslaughter Jawas?Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio areinspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.43.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)If they traced the robots here,they may have learned who they soldthem to.

Various strangeforms of transport, including several unusual beasts ofburden, are parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up andbegins to fondle the speeder.THREEPIOI can't abide these Jawas.Disgusting creatures.46.As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawaaway.LUKEGo on, go on. I can't understandhow we got by those troopers. Ithought we were dead.BENThe Force can have a stronginfluence on the weak-minded.

TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA 57The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants followBen Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldyden is filled with a startling array of weird and exoticalien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. Atfirst the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed,slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddleover drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near agroup of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-lookingBartender stops Luke and the robots.BARTENDERWe don't serve their kind here!Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so manyoutlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender'sdrift.LUKEWhat?47.BARTENDERYour droids. They'll have to waitoutside. We don't want them here.Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of theGalactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesomecreatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendlyglare.Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.LUKEListen, why don't you wait out bythe speeder. We don't want anytrouble.THREEPIOI heartily agree with you sir.Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of thecreatures at the bar go back to their drinks.Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savagelooking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey withfierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a furcovered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and asight to behold.Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several timesduring his conversation and the huge creature suddenly letsout a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bitdisconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversationbetween Ben and the giant Wookiee.Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sipshis drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic earor whatever.A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.CREATURENegola dewaghi wooldugger?!?The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignorethe creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubbyHuman and an even smaller rodent-like beast join thebelligerent monstrosity.HUMANHe doesn't like you.48.LUKEI'm sorry.HUMANI don't like you either.The big creature is getting agitated and yells out someunintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, youngadventurer.HUMAN (CONT\u2019D)Don't insult us. You just watchyourself. We're wanted men. I havethe death sentence in twelvesystems.LUKEI'll be careful than.HUMANYou'll be dead.The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the barmoves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. Histhree adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves inbehind Luke.BENThis little one isn't worth theeffort. Come let me buy yousomething...A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the youngwould-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing throughtables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-lookingliquid. With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws awicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it atold Ben. The bartender panics.BARTENDERNo blasters! No blaster!With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to lifeand in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cutin two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turnsoff his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt.Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities,attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matterof seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben isgiven a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbinghis bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Benpoints the the Wookiee.49.BENThis is Chewbacca. He's first-mateon a ship that might suit ourneeds.58 EXT.

Chewie heretells me you're looking for passageto the Alderaan system.BENYes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.HANFast ship? You've never heard ofthe Millennium Falcon?BENShould I have?HANIt's the ship that made the Kesselrun in less than twelve parsecs!Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them withobvious misinformation.HAN (CONT\u2019D)I've outrun Imperial starships, notthe local bulk-cruisers, mind you.I'm talking about the big Corellianships now. She's fast enough foryou, old man. What's the cargo?50.BENOnly passengers. Myself, the boy,two droids, and no questions asked.HANWhat is it?

As a matter of fact, Iwas just going to see your boss.Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding thegun on him.GREEDOIt's too late.

You don'tknow how hard I found it signingthe order to terminate your life!LEIAI surprised you had the courage totake the responsibility yourself!TARKINPrincess Leia, before yourexecution I would like you to be myguest at a ceremony that will makethis battle station operational.(MORE)61.No star system will dare oppose theEmperor now.LEIAThe more you tighten your grip,Tarkin, the more star systems willslip through your fingers.TARKINNot after we demonstrate the powerof this station. In a way, you havedetermined the choice of the planetthat'll be destroyed first. Sinceyou are reluctant to provide uswith the location of the Rebelbase, I have chosen to test thisstation's destructive power... onyour home planet of Alderaan.LEIANo! Alderaan is peaceful. We haveno weapons. You can't possibly...TARKINYou would prefer another target? Amilitary target? Then name thesystem!Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.TARKIN (CONT\u2019D)I grow tired of asking this. Soit'll be the last time. Where isthe Rebel base?Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach toAlderaan.LEIA(softly)Dantooine.Leia lowers her head.LEIA (CONT\u2019D)They're on Dantooine.TARKINThere. You see Lord Vader, she canbe reasonable.(addressing Motti)Continue with the operation. Youmay fire when ready.TARKIN (CONT'D)62.LEIAWhat?TARKINYou're far too trusting. Dantooineis too remote to make an effectivedemonstration. But don't worry. Wewill deal with your Rebel friendssoon enough.LEIANo!85 INT. DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER 85VADERCommence primary ignition.A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. Ahooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still anotherlever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. Ahuge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped areaand converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan.The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.86 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA 86Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small\"seeker\" robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. Hefalters, seems almost faint.LUKEAre you all right? What's wrong?BENI felt a great disturbance in theForce... as if millions of voicessuddenly cried out in terror andwere suddenly silenced. I fearsomething terrible has happened.Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Thenhe fixes his gaze on Luke.BEN (CONT\u2019D)You'd better get on with yourexercises.Han Solo enters the room.63.HANWell, you can forget your troubleswith those Imperial slugs. I toldyou I'd outrun 'em.Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.HAN (CONT\u2019D)Don't everyone thank me at once.Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in agame in which three-dimensional holographic figures movealong a chess-type board.HAN (CONT\u2019D)Anyway, we should be at Alderaanabout oh-two-hundred hours.Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted tablecovered with small holographic monsters. Each side of thetable has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbaccaseems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky furcovered arms over his head.THREEPIONow be careful, Artoo.Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with hisstubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creaturesto walk to the new square. A sudden frown crossesChewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tinyrobot. Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companionand begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)He made a fair move. Screamingabout it won't help you.HAN(interrupting)Let him have it. It's not wise toupset a Wookiee.THREEPIOBut sir, nobody worries aboutupsetting a droid.HANThat's 'cause droids don't pullpeople's arms out of their socketwhen they lose. Wookiees are knownto do that.64.THREEPIOI see your point, sir. I suggest anew strategy, Artoo. Let theWookiee win.Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seemsfrozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over hishead. Ben watches him from the corner, studying hismovements. Han watches with a bit of smugness.BENRemember, a Jedi can feel the Forceflowing through him.LUKEYou mean it controls your actions?BENPartially. But it also obeys yourcommands.Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a\"seeker\", a chrome baseball-like robot covered withantennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats toone side of the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes alightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke'sface. Luke doesn't move and the ball backs off. It slowlymoves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, thistime emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. It hitsLuke in the leg causing him to tumble over. Han lets loosewith a burst of laughter.HANHokey religions and ancient weaponsare no match for a good blaster atyour side, kid.LUKEYou don't believe in the Force, doyou?HANKid, I've flown from one side ofthis galaxy to the other. I've seena lot of strange stuff, but I'venever seen anything to make mebelieve there's one all-powerfulforce controlling everything.There's no mystical energy fieldthat controls my destiny.Ben smiles quietly.65.HAN (CONT\u2019D)It's all a lot of simple tricks andnonsense.BENI suggest you try it again, Luke.Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers hiseyes.BEN (CONT\u2019D)This time, let go your consciousself and act on instinct.LUKE(laughing)With the blast shield down, I can'teven see. How am I supposed tofight?BENYour eyes can deceive you. Don'ttrust them.Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seekerinto the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, thendrops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindlymissing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hitsLuke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painfulyell and attempts to hit the seeker.BEN (CONT\u2019D)Stretch out with your feelings.Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makesa dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect thebolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its originalposition.BEN (CONT\u2019D)You see, you can do it.HANI call it luck.BENIn my experience, there's no suchthing as luck.HANLook, going good against remotes isone thing. Going good against theliving? That's something else.66.Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of thecontrol panel.HAN (CONT\u2019D)Looks like we're coming up onAlderaan.Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.LUKEYou know, I did feel something. Icould almost see the remote.BENThat's good. You have taken yourfirst step into a larger world.87 INT.

Cutin the sublight engines.67.Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpitwindow stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease inspeed, then stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudderand violently shake about. Asteroids begin to race towardthem, battering the sides of the ship.HAN (CONT\u2019D)What the...? Aw, we've come out ofhyperspace into a meteor shower.Some kind of asteroid collision.It's not on any of the charts.The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very coolin the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncingcockpit.LUKEWhat's going on?HANOur position is correct, except...no, Alderaan!LUKEWhat do you mean? Where is it?HANThats what I'm trying to tell you,kid. It ain't there. It's beentotally blown away.LUKEWhat?

It'd takea thousand ships with more firepower than I've...A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffledalarm starts humming.HAN (CONT\u2019D)There's another ship coming in.LUKEMaybe they know what happened.68.BENIt's an Imperial fighter.Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outsidethe cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny,finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.LUKEIt followed us!BENNo. It's a short range fighter.HANThere aren't any bases around here.Where did it come from?90 EXT.

MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT 93The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tinyfighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighteruntil it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Benstands behind Chewbacca.BENA fighter that size couldn't getthis deep into space on its own.69.LUKEIt must have gotten lost, been partof a convoy or something.HANWell, he ain't going to be aroundlong enough to tell anyone aboutus.94 EXT.

MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT 95The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon orplanet.LUKELook at him. He's headed for thatsmall moon.HANI think I can get him before hegets there... he's almost in range.The small moon begins to take on the appearance of amonstrous spherical battle station.BENThat's no moon! It's a spacestation.HANIt's too big to be a space station.LUKEI have a very bad feeling aboutthis.HANYeah, I think your right. Fullreverse! Chewie, lock in theauxiliary power.The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates awaytoward the gargantuan battle station.LUKEWhy are we still moving towards it?70.HANWe're caught in a tractor beam!It's pulling us in!LUKEBut there's gotta be something youcan do!HANThere's nothin' I can do about it,kid.

MILLENNIUM FALCON - DEATH STAR 96As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to theawesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battlestation becomes staggering. Running along the equator of thegigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking portsinto which the helpless pirateship is dragged.97 EXT.

The muffled sounds of a distantofficer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panelssuddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobisticks his head out of a third locker.LUKEBoy, it's lucky you had thesecompartments.HANI use them for smuggling. I neverthought I'd be smuggling myself inthem. This is ridiculous. Even if Icould take off, I'd never get pastthe tractor beam.BENLeave that to me!HANDamn fool. I knew that you weregoing to say that!BENWho's the more foolish... the foolor the fool who follows him?73.Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.105 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY 105The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past thetwo stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.TROOPERThe ship's all yours. If thescanners pick up anything, reportit immediately. All right, let'sgo.The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing soundis followed by a voice calling to the guard below.HAN'S VOICEHey down there, could you give us ahand with this?The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round ofgunfire is heard.106 INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE 106In a very small command office near the entrance to thepirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window andnotices the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.GANTRY OFFICERTX-four-one-two. Why aren't you atyour post? TX-four-one-two, do youcopy?A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship andwaves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicatinghis comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes hishead in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide anannoyed look.GANTRY OFFICER (CONT\u2019D)Take over. We've got a badtransmitter. I'll see what I cando.As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealingthe towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentarystate of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chillinghowl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow.The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blastedby Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and therobots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressedas a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.74.LUKEYou know, between his howling andyour blasting everything in sight,it's a wonder the whole stationdoesn't know we're here.HANBring them on! I prefer a straightfight to all this sneaking around.THREEPIOWe found the computer outlet, sir.Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map ofthe city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect itcarefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.BENPlug in. He should be able tointerpret the entire Imperialcomputer network.Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and thevast Imperial brain network comes to life, feedinginformation to the little robot. After a few moments, hebeeps something.THREEPIOHe says he's found the maincomputer to power the tractor beamthat's holding the ship here. He'lltry to make the precise locationappear on the monitor.The computer monitor flashes readouts.THREEPIO (CONT\u2019D)The tractor beam is coupled to themain reactor in seven locations. Apower loss at one of the terminalswill allow the ship to leave.Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.BENI don't think you boys can help. Imust go alone.HANWhatever you say. I've done morethat I bargained for on this tripalready.75.LUKEI want to go with you.BENBe patient, Luke. Stay and watchover the droids.LUKEBut he can...BENThey must be delivered safely orother star systems will suffer thesame fate as Alderaan. Your destinylies along a different path thanmine. The Force will be with you...always!Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently stepsout of the command office, then disappears down a long greyhallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his headin agreement.HANBoy you said it, Chewie.Han looks at Luke.HAN (CONT\u2019D)Where did you dig up that oldfossil?LUKEBen is a great man.HANYeah, great at getting us intotrouble.LUKEI didn't hear you give any ideas...HANWell, anything would be better thanjust hanging around waiting for himto pick us up...LUKEWho do you think...Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.Luke goes over to him.76.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)What is it?THREEPIOI'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.He says \"I found her\", and keepsrepeating, \"She's here.\"LUKEWell, who... who has he found?Artoo whistles a frantic reply.THREEPIOPrincess Leia.LUKEThe princess?

The old man wants us to waitright here.LUKEBut he didn't know she was here.Look, will you just find a way backinto the detention block?HANI'm not going anywhere.77.LUKEThey're going to execute her. Look,a few minutes ago you said youdidn't want to just wait here to becaptured.

Listen, if youwere to rescue her, the rewardwould be...HANWhat?LUKEWell more wealth that you canimagine.HANI don't know, I can imagine quite abit!LUKEYou'll get it!HANI better!LUKEYou will...HANAll right, kid. But you'd better beright about this.78.Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.LUKEAll right.HANWhat's your plan?LUKEUh... Threepio, hand me thosebinders there will you?Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)Okay. Now, I'm going to put theseon you.Chewie lets out a hideous growl.LUKE (CONT\u2019D)Okay. Han, you put these on.Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.HANDon't worry, Chewie. I think I knowwhat he has in mind.The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face asHan binds him with the electronic cuffs.THREEPIOMaster Luke, sir! Pardon me forasking... but, ah... what shouldArtoo and I do if we're discoveredhere?LUKELock the door!HANAnd hope they don't have blasters.THREEPIOThat isn't very reassuring.Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets andstart off into the giant Imperial Death Star.107 INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE 107Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armoredsuits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive.79.Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring thetrio completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curiousglance.Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.LUKEI can't see a thing in this helmet.A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled awayby Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed andthe elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.108 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY 108Several Imperial officers walk through the wide mainpassageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robotsimilar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far endof the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, thendisappears down a small hallway. His appearance is sofleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just anillusion. No one in the hallway seems to notice him.109 INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY109AREALuke and Han step forward to exitthe elevator, but the door slidesopen behind them. The giant Wookieeand his two guards enter the oldgrey security station. Guards andlaser gates are everywhere.

A tall, grim looking Officer approachesthe trio.OFFICERWhere are you taking this... thing?Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shutup.80.LUKEPrisoner transfer from Block oneone- three-eight.OFFICERI wasn't notified. I'll have toclear it.The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch inthe information. There are only three other troopers in thearea. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of thealarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one ofChewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with oneof his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.HANLook out! He's loose!LUKEHe's going to pull us all apart.HANGo get him!The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke andHan have already pulled out their laser pistols and areblasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage oflaserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, lasergate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is thelast of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he isabout to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlinksystem, which is screeching questions about what is goingon. He quickly checks the computer readout.HAN (CONT\u2019D)We've got to find out which cellthis princess of yours is in. Hereit is... cell twenty-one-eightseven. You go get her. I'll holdthem here.Luke races down one of the cell corridors.

When you camein here, didn't you have a plan forgetting out?HAN(pointing to Luke)He's the brains, sweetheart.Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.85.LUKEWell, I didn't...The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate inthe wall next to Han, almost frying him.HANWhat the hell are you doing?LEIASomebody has to save our skins.Into the garbage chute, wise guy.She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbaccalook on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute andsays something.HANGet in there you big furry oaf! Idon't care what you smell! Get inthere and don't worry about it.Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into thetiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they worktheir way toward the opening.HAN (CONT\u2019D)Wonderful girl! Either I'm going tokill her or I'm beginning to likeher. Get in there!Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Hanfires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover,then slides into the chute himself and is gone.116 INT.

Washington\nPresidt and deputy from Virginia\n',bibleMatthewsGospel:"Chapter 1\nThe book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the\nson of David, the son of Abraham:\n2 Abraham begot Isaac. And Isaac begot Jacob. And Jacob begot Judas and his brethren.\n3 And Judas begot Phares and Zara of\nThamar. And Phares begot Esron. And Esron\nbegot Aram.\n4 And Aram begot Aminadab. And Aminadab begot Naasson. And Naasson begot\nSalmon.\n5 And Salmon begot Booz of Rahab. And\nBooz begot Obed of Ruth. And Obed begot\nJesse.\n6 And Jesse begot David the king. And David\nthe king begot Solomon, of her that had been the\nwife of Urias.\n7 And Solomon begot Roboam. And Roboam\nbegot Abia. And Abia begot Asa.\n8 And Asa begot Josaphat. And Josaphat begot Joram. And Joram begot Ozias.\n9 And Ozias begot Joatham. And Joatham\nbegot Achaz. And Achaz begot Ezechias.\n10 And Ezechias begot Manasses. And\nManesses begot Amon. And Amon begot Josias.\n11 And Josias begot Jechonias and his\nbrethren in the transmigration of Babylon.\n12 And after the transmigration of Babylon,\nJechonias begot Salathiel. And Salathiel begot\nZorobabel.\n13 And Zorobabel begot Abiud. And Abiud\nbegot Eliacim. And Eliacim begot Azor.\n14 And Azor begot Sadoc. And Sadoc begot\nAchim. And Achim begot Eliud.\n15 And Eliud begot Eleazar. And Eleazar begot Mathan. And Mathan begot Jacob.\n16 And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of\nMary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called\nChrist.\n17 So all the generations, from Abraham to\nDavid, are fourteen generations. And from\nDavid to the transmigration of Babylon, are\nfourteen generations: and from the transmigration of Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.\n18 Now the generation of Christ was in this\nwise. When as his mother Mary was espoused\nto Joseph, before they came together, she was\nfound with child, of the Holy Ghost.\n19 Whereupon Joseph her husband, being a\njust man, and not willing publicly to expose her,\nwas minded to put her away privately.\n20 But while he thought on these things, behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in\nhis sleep, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not\nto take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which\nis conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost.\n21 And she shall bring forth a son: and thou\nshalt call his name JESUS. For he shall save his\npeople from their sins.\n22 Now all this was done that it might be\nfulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet,\nsaying:\n23 Behold a virgin shall be with child, and\nbring forth a son, and they shall call his name\nEmmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with\nus.\n24 And Joseph rising up from sleep, did as the\nangel of the Lord had commanded him, and took\nunto him his wife.\n25 And he knew her not till she brought forth\nher firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.\n\nChapter 2\nWhen Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of\nJuda, in the days of king Herod, behold, there\ncame wise men from the east to Jerusalem.\n2 Saying, Where is he that is born king of the\nJews? For we have seen his star in the east, and\nare come to adore him.\n3 And king Herod hearing this, was troubled,\nand all Jerusalem with him.\n4 And assembling together all the chief priests\nand the scribes of the people, he inquired of them\nwhere Christ should be born.\n5 But they said to him: In Bethlehem of Juda.\nFor so it is written by the prophet:\n6 And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art\nnot the least among the princes of Juda: for out\nof thee shall come forth the captain that shall\nrule my people Israel.\n7 Then Herod, privately calling the wise men,\nlearned diligently of them the time of the star\nwhich appeared to them;\n8 And sending them into Bethlehem, said: Go\nand diligently inquire after the child, and when\nyou have found him, bring me word again, that\nI also may come to adore him.\n9 Who having heard the king, went their way;\nand behold the star which they had seen in the\neast, went before them, until it came and stood\nover where the child was.\n10 And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.\n11 And entering into the house, they found the\nchild with Mary his mother, and falling down\nthey adored him; and opening their treasures,\nthey offered him gifts; gold, frankincense, and\nmyrrh.\n12 And having received an answer in sleep\nthat they should not return to Herod, they went\nback another way into their country.\n13 And after they were departed, behold an\nangel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph,\nsaying: Arise, and take the child and his mother,\nand fly into Egypt: and be there until I shall tell\nthee. For it will come to pass that Herod will\nseek the child to destroy him.\n14 Who arose, and took the child and his\nmother by night, and retired into Egypt: and\nhe was there until the death of Herod:\n15 That it might be fulfilled which the Lord\nspoke by the prophet, saying: Out of Egypt have\nI called my son.\n16 Then Herod perceiving that he was deluded\nby the wise men, was exceeding angry; and sending killed all the men children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two\nyears old and under, according to the time which\nhe had diligently inquired of the wise men.\n17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken\nby Jeremias the prophet, saying:\n18 A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation\nand great mourning; Rachel bewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they\nare not.\n19 But when Herod was dead, behold an angel\nof the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt,\n20 Saying: Arise, and take the child and his\nmother, and go into the land of Israel. For they\nare dead that sought the life of the child.\n21 Who arose, and took the child and his\nmother, and came into the land of Israel.\n22 But hearing that Archelaus reigned in\nJudea in the room of Herod his father, he was\nafraid to go thither: and being warned in sleep\nretired into the quarters of Galilee.\n23 And coming he dwelt in a city called\nNazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was\nsaid by prophets: That he shall be called a\nNazarene.\n\nChapter 3\nAnd in those days cometh John the Baptist\npreaching in the desert of Judea.\n2 And saying: Do penance: for the kingdom\nof heaven is at hand.\n3 For this is he that was spoken of by Isaias\nthe prophet, saying: A voice of one crying in the\ndesert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make\nstraight his paths.\n4 And the same John had his garment of\ncamels\u2019 hair, and a leathern girdle about his\nloins: and his meat was locusts and wild honey.\n5 Then went out to him Jerusalem and all\nJudea, and all the country about Jordan:\n6 And were baptized by him in the Jordan,\nconfessing their sins.\n7 And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them:\nYe brood of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee\nfrom the wrath to come?\n8 Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of\npenance.\n9 And think not to say within yourselves, We\nhave Abraham for our father. For I tell you that\nGod is able of these stones to raise up children\nto Abraham.\n10 For now the axe is laid to the root of the\ntrees. Every tree therefore that doth not yield\ngood fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the\nfire.\n11 I indeed baptize you in the water unto\npenance, but he that shall come after me, is\nmightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy\nto bear; he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost\nand fire.\n12 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and gather his wheat\ninto the barn; but the chaff he will burn with\nunquenchable fire.\n13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by him.\n14 But John stayed him, saying: I ought to\nbe baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?\n15 And Jesus answering, said to him: Suffer\nit to be so now. For so it becometh us to fulfill\nall justice. Then he suffered him.\n16 And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came\nout of the water: and lo, the heavens were\nopened to him: and he saw the Spirit of God\ndescending as a dove, and coming upon him.\n17 And behold a voice from heaven, saying:\nThis is my beloved Son, in whom I am well\npleased.\n\nChapter 4\nThen Jesus was led by the spirit into the desert,\nto be tempted by the devil.\n2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty\nnights, afterwards he was hungry.\n3 And the tempter coming said to him: If thou\nbe the Son of God, command that these stones\nbe made bread.\n4 Who answered and said: It is written, Not\nin bread alone doth man live, but in every word\nthat proceedeth from the mouth of God.\n5 Then the devil took him up into the holy\ncity, and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple,\n6 And said to him: If thou be the Son of God,\ncast thyself down, for it is written: That he hath\ngiven his angels charge over thee, and in their\nhands shall they bear thee up, lest perhaps thou\ndash thy foot against a stone.\n7 Jesus said to him: It is written again: Thou\nshalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\n8 Again the devil took him up into a very high\nmountain, and shewed him all the kingdoms of\nthe world, and the glory of them,\n9 And said to him: All these will I give thee,\nif falling down thou wilt adore me.\n10 Then Jesus saith to him: Begone, Satan:\nfor it is written, The Lord thy God shalt thou\nadore, and him only shalt thou serve.\n11 Then the devil left him; and behold angels\ncame and ministered to him.\n12 And when Jesus had heard that John was\ndelivered up, he retired into Galilee:\n13 And leaving the city Nazareth, he came\nand dwelt in Capharnaum on the sea coast, in\nthe borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;\n14 That it might be fulfilled which was said\nby Isaias the prophet:\n15 Land of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim,\nthe way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of\nthe Gentiles:\n16 The people that sat in darkness, hath seen\ngreat light: and to them that sat in the region\nof the shadow of death, light is sprung up.\n17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and\nto say: Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven\nis at hand.\n18 And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee,\nsaw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter,\nand Andrew his brother, casting a net into the\nsea (for they were fishers).\n19 And he saith to them: Come ye after me,\nand I will make you to be fishers of men.\n20 And they immediately leaving their nets,\nfollowed him.\n21 And going on from thence, he saw other\ntwo brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and\nJohn his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their\nfather, mending their nets: and he called them.\n22 And they forthwith left their nets and father, and followed him.\n23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching\nin their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of\nthe kingdom: and healing all manner of sickness\nand every infirmity, among the people.\n24 And his fame went throughout all Syria,\nand they presented to him all sick people that\nwere taken with divers diseases and torments,\nand such as were possessed by devils, and lunatics, and those that had palsy, and he cured\nthem:\n25 And much people followed him from\nGalilee, and from Decapolis, and from\nJerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.\n\nChapter 5\nAnd seeing the multitudes, he went up into a\nmountain, and when he was set down, his disciples came unto him.\n2 And opening his mouth, he taught them,\nsaying:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is\nthe kingdom of heaven.\n4 Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess\nthe land.\n5 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall\nbe comforted.\n6 Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after\njustice: for they shall have their fill.\n7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\n8 Blessed are the clean of heart: for they shall\nsee God.\n9 Blesses are the peacemakers: for they shall\nbe called children of God.\n10 Blessed are they that suffer persecution for\njustice\u2019 sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n11 Blessed are ye when they shall revile you,\nand persecute you, and speak all that is evil\nagainst you, untruly, for my sake:\n12 Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is\nvery great in heaven. For so they persecuted\nthe prophets that were before you.\n13 You are the salt of the earth. But if the\nsalt lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?\nIt is good for nothing any more but to be cast\nout, and to be trodden on by men.\n14 You are the light of the world. A city seated\non a mountain cannot be hid.\n15 Neither do men light a candle and put it\nunder a bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it\nmay shine to all that are in the house.\n16 So let your light shine before men, that\nthey may see your good works, and glorify your\nFather who is in heaven.\n17 Do not think that I am come to destroy the\nlaw, or the prophets. I am not come to destroy,\nbut to fulfill.\n18 For amen I say unto you, till heaven and\nearth pass, one jot, or one tittle shall not pass of\nthe law, till all be fulfilled.\n19 He therefore that shall break one of these\nleast commandments, and shall so teach men,\nshall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.\nBut he that shall do and teach, he shall be called\ngreat in the kingdom of heaven.\n20 For I tell you, that unless your justice\nabound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of\nheaven.\n21 You have heard that it was said to them\nof old: Thou shalt not kill. And whosoever shall\nkill shall be in danger of the judgment.\n22 But I say to you, that whosoever is angry\nwith his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother,\nRaca, shall be in danger of the council. And\nwhosoever shall say, Thou Fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.\n23 If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar,\nand there thou remember that thy brother hath\nany thing against thee;\n24 Leave there thy offering before the altar,\nand go first to be reconciled to thy brother: and\nthen coming thou shalt offer thy gift.\n25 Be at agreement with thy adversary betimes, whilst thou art in the way with him: lest\nperhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge,\nand the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou\nbe cast into prison.\n26 Amen I say to thee, thou shalt not go out\nfrom thence till thou repay last farthing.\n27 You have heard that it was said to them of\nold: Thou shalt not commit adultery.\n28 But I say to you, that whosoever shall look\non a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.\n29 And if thy right eye scandalize thee, pluck\nit out and cast it from thee. For it is expedient\nfor thee that one of thy members should perish,\nrather than that thy whole body be cast into hell.\n30 And if thy right hand scandalize thee, cut\nit off, and cast it from thee: for it is expedient\nfor thee that one of thy members should perish,\nrather than that thy whole body be cast into\nhell.\n31 And it hath been said, Whoseoever shall\nput away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.\n32 But I say to you, that whosoever shall put\naway his wife, excepting for the cause of fornication, maketh her to commit adultery: and he\nthat shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.\n33 Again you have heard that it was said to\nthem of old, Thou shalt not forswear thyself: but\nthou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord.\n34 But I say to you not to swear at all, neither\nby heaven, for it is the throne of God:\n35 Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool: nor\nby Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king:\n36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or\nblack.\n37 But let your speech be yea, yea: no, no:\nand that which is over and above these, is of\nevil.\n38 You have heard that it hath been said, An\neye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.\n39 But I say to you not to resist evil: but if\none strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him\nalso the other:\n40 And if a man will contend with thee in\njudgment, and take away thy coat, let go thy\ncloak also unto him.\n41 And whosoever will force thee one mile, go\nwith him other two,\n42 Give to him that asketh of thee and from\nhim that would borrow of thee turn not away.\n43 You have heard that it hath been said,\nThou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thy enemy.\n44 But I say to you, Love your enemies: do\ngood to them that hate you: and pray for them\nthat persecute and calumniate you:\n45 That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven, who maketh his sun to\nrise upon the good, and bad, and raineth upon\nthe just and the unjust.\n46 For if you love them that love you, what\nreward shall you have? do not even the publicans\nthis?\n47 And if you salute your brethren only, what\ndo you more? do not also the heathens this?\n48 Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect.\n\nChapter 6\nTake heed that you do not your justice before\nmen, to be seen by them: otherwise you shall not\nhave a reward of your Father who is in heaven.\n2 Therefore when thou dost an almsdeed,\nsound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets,\nthat they may be honoured by men. Amen I say\nto you, they have received their reward.\n3 But when thou dost alms, let not thy left\nhand know what thy right hand doth.\n4 That thy alms may be in secret, and thy\nFather who seeth in secret will repay thee.\n5 And when ye pray, you shall not be as the\nhypocrites, that love to stand and pray in the\nsynagogues and corners of the streets, that they\nmay be seen by men: Amen I say to you, they\nhave received their reward.\n6 But thou when thou shalt pray, enter into\nthy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to\nthy Father in secret: and thy Father who seeth\nin secret will repay thee.\n7 And when you are praying, speak not much,\nas the heathens. For they think that in their\nmuch speaking they may be heard.\n8 Be not you therefore like to them, for your\nFather knoweth what is needful for you, before\nyou ask him.\n9 Thus therefore shall you pray: Our Father\nwho art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on\nearth as it is in heaven.\n11 Give us this day our supersubstantial\nbread.\n12 And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive\nour debtors.\n13 And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Amen.\n14 For if you will forgive men their offences,\nyour heavenly Father will forgive you also your\noffences.\n15 But if you will not forgive men, neither will\nyour Father forgive you your offences.\n16 And when you fast, be not as the hypocrites, sad. For they disfigure their faces, that\nthey may appear unto men to fast. Amen I say\nto you, they have received their reward.\n17 But thou, when thou fastest anoint thy\nhead, and wash thy face;\n18 That thou appear not to men to fast, but\nto thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father\nwho seeth in secret, will repay thee.\n19 Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth:\nwhere the rust, and moth consume, and where\nthieves break through and steal.\n20 But lay up to yourselves treasures in\nheaven: where neither the rust nor moth\ndoth consume, and where thieves do not break\nthrough, nor steal.\n21 For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart\nalso.\n22 The light of thy body is thy eye. If thy eye\nbe single, thy whole body shall be lightsome.\n23 But if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall\nbe darksome. If then the light that is in thee, be\ndarkness: the darkness itself how great shall it\nbe!\n24 No man can serve two masters. For either\nhe will hate the one, and love the other: or he\nwill sustain the one, and despise the other. You\ncannot serve God and mammon.\n25 Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous for\nyour life, what you shall eat, nor for your body,\nwhat you shall put on. Is not the life more than\nthe meat: and the body more than the raiment?\n26 Behold the birds of the air, for they neither\nsow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns: and\nyour heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not you\nof much more value than they?\n27 And which of you by taking thought, can\nadd to his stature by one cubit?\n28 And for raiment why are you solicitous?\nConsider the lilies of the field, how they grow:\nthey labour not, neither do they spin.\n29 But I say to you, that not even Solomon in\nall his glory was arrayed as one of these.\n30 And if the grass of the field, which is to day,\nand to morrow is cast into the oven, God doth so\nclothe: how much more you, O ye of little faith?\n31 Be not solicitous therefore, saying, What\nshall we eat: or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed?\n32 For after all these things do the heathens\nseek. For your Father knoweth that you have\nneed of all these things.\n33 Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God,\nand his justice, and all these things shall be\nadded unto you.\n34 Be not therefore solicitous for to morrow;\nfor the morrow will be solicitous for itself. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.\n\nChapter 7\nJudge not, that you may not be judged,\n2 For with what judgment you judge, you shall\nbe judged: and with what measure you mete, it\nshall be measured to you again.\n3 Any why seest thou the mote that is in thy\nbrother\u2019s eye; and seest not the beam that is in\nthy own eye?\n4 Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me\ncast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam\nis in thy own eye?\n5 Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam in\nthy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out\nthe mote out of thy brother\u2019s eye.\n6 Give not that which is holy to dogs; neither\ncast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps\nthey trample them under their feet, and turning\nupon you, they tear you.\n7 Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you\nshall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.\n8 For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he\nthat seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh,\nit shall be opened.\n9 Or what man is there among you, of whom\nif his son shall ask bread, will he reach him a\nstone?\n10 Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach\nhim a serpent?\n11 If you then being evil, know how to give\ngood gifts to your children: how much more will\nyour Father who is in heaven, give good things\nto them that ask him?\n12 All things therefore whatsoever you would\nthat men should do to you, do you also to them.\nFor this is the law and the prophets.\n13 Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide\nis the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth\nto destruction, and many there are who go in\nthereat.\n14 How narrow is the gate, and strait is the\nway that leadeth to life: and few there are that\nfind it!\n15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you\nin the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are\nravening wolves.\n16 By their fruits you shall know them. Do\nmen gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\n17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth\ngood fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil\nfruit.\n18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,\nneither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.\n19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good\nfruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into\nthe fire.\n20 Wherefore by their fruits you shall know\nthem.\n21 Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord,\nshall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he\nthat doth the will of my Father who is in heaven,\nhe shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n22 Many will say to me in that day: Lord,\nLord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and\ncast out devils in thy name, and done many miracles in thy name?\n23 And then will I profess unto them, I never\nknew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.\n24 Every one therefore that heareth these my\nwords, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise\nman that built his house upon a rock,\n25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and\nthe winds blew, and they beat upon that house,\nand it fell not, for it was founded on a rock.\n26 And every one that heareth these my\nwords, and doth them not, shall be like a foolish\nman that built his house upon the sand,\n27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and\nthe winds blew, and they beat upon that house,\nand it fell, and great was the fall thereof.\n28 And it came to pass when Jesus had fully\nended these words, the people were in admiration\nat his doctrine.\n29 For he was teaching them as one having\npower, and not as the scribes and Pharisees.\n\nChapter 8\nAnd when he was come down from the mountain,\ngreat multitudes followed him:\n2 And behold a leper came and adored him,\nsaying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me\nclean.\n3 And Jesus stretching forth his hand, touched\nhim, saying: I will, be thou made clean. And\nforthwith his leprosy was cleansed.\n4 And Jesus saith to him: See thou tell no\nman: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer\nthe gift which Moses commanded for a testimony\nunto them.\n5 And when he had entered into Capharnaum,\nthere came to him a centurion, beseeching him,\n6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home\nsick of the palsy, and is grieviously tormented.\n7 And Jesus saith to him: I will come and heal\nhim.\n8 And the centurion making answer, said:\nLord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof: but only say the word, and\nmy servant shall be healed.\n9 For I also am a man subject to authority, having under me soldiers; and I say to this,\nGo, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and\nhe cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he\ndoeth it.\n10 And Jesus hearing this, marvelled; and said\nto them that followed him: Amen I say to you,\nI have not found so great faith in Israel.\n11 And I say to you that many shall come from\nthe east and the west, and shall sit down with\nAbraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom\nof heaven:\n12 But the children of the kingdom shall be\ncast out into the exterior darkness: there shall\nbe weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n13 And Jesus said to the centurion: Go, and\nas thou hast believed, so be it done to thee. And\nthe servant was healed at the same hour.\n14 And when Jesus was come into Peter\u2019s\nhouse, he saw his wife\u2019s mother lying, and sick\nof a fever:\n15 And he touched her hand, and the fever\nleft her, and she arose and ministered to them.\n16 And when evening was come, they brought\nto him many that were possessed with devils:\nand he cast out the spirits with his word: and\nall that were sick he healed:\n17 That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet Isaias, saying: He took our\ninfirmities, and bore our diseases.\n18 And Jesus seeing great multitudes about\nhim, gave orders to pass over the water.\n19 And a certain scribe came and said to him:\nMaster, I will follow thee whithersoever thou\nshalt go.\n20 And Jesus saith to him: The foxes have\nholes, and the birds of the air nests: but the son\nof man hath not where to lay his head.\n21 And another of his disciples said to him:\nLord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.\n22 But Jesus said to him: Follow me, and let\nthe dead bury their dead.\n23 And when he entered into the boat, his\ndisciples followed him:\n24 And behold a great tempest arose in the\nsea, so that the boat was covered with waves,\nbut he was asleep.\n25 And they came to him, and awaked him,\nsaying: Lord, save us, we perish.\n26 And Jesus saith to them: Why are you\nfearful, O ye of little faith? Then rising up he\ncommanded the winds, and the sea, and there\ncame a great calm.\n27 But the men wondered, saying: What manner of man is this, for the winds and the sea obey\nhim?\n28 And when he was come on the other side of\nthe water, into the country of the Gerasens, there\nmet him two that were possessed with devils,\ncoming out of the sepulchres, exceeding fierce,\nso that none could pass by that way.\n29 And behold they cried out, saying: What\nhave we to do with thee, Jesus Son of God? art\nthou come hither to torment us before the time?\n30 And there was, not far from them, an herd\nof many swine feeding.\n31 And the devils besought him, saying: If\nthou cast us out hence, send us into the herd of\nswine.\n32 And he said to them: Go. But they going\nout went into the swine, and behold the whole\nherd ran violently down a steep place into the\nsea: and they perished in the waters.\n33 And they that kept them fled: and coming\ninto the city, told every thing, and concerning\nthem that had been possessed by the devils.\n34 And behold the whole city went out to meet\nJesus, and when they saw him, they besought\nhim that he would depart from their coasts.\n\nChapter 9\nAnd entering into a boat, he passed over the water and came into his own city.\n2 And behold they brought to him one sick of\nthe palsy lying in a bed. And Jesus, seeing their\nfaith, said to the man sick of the palsy: Be of\ngood heart, son, thy sins are forgiven thee.\n3 And behold some of the scribes said within\nthemselves: He blasphemeth.\n4 And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said: Why\ndo you think evil in your hearts?\n5 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee: or to say, Arise, and walk?\n6 But that you may know that the Son of man\nhath power on earth to forgive sins, (then said\nhe to the man sick of palsy,) Arise, take up thy\nbed, and go into thy house.\n7 And he arose, and went into his house.\n8 And the multitude seeing it, feared, and glorified God that gave such power to men.\n9 And when Jesus passed on from hence, he\nsaw a man sitting in the custom house, named\nMatthew; and he saith to him: Follow me. And\nhe rose up and followed him.\n10 And it came to pass as he was sitting at\nmeat in the house, behold many publicans and\nsinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his\ndisciples.\n11 And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans\nand sinners?\n12 But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are\nin health need not a physician, but they that are\nill.\n13 Go then and learn what this meaneth, I\nwill have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not\ncome to call the just, but sinners.\n14 Then came to him the disciples of John,\nsaying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often,\nbut thy disciples do not fast?\n15 And Jesus said to them: Can the children\nof the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come,\nwhen the bridegroom shall be taken away from\nthem, and then they shall fast.\n16 And nobody putteth a piece of raw cloth\nunto an old garment. For it taketh away the\nfullness thereof from the garment, and there is\nmade a greater rent.\n17 Neither do they put new wine into old bottles. Otherwise the bottles break, and the wine\nrunneth out, and the bottles perish. But new\nwine they put into new bottles: and both are\npreserved.\n18 And he was speaking these things unto\nthem, behold a certain ruler came up, and\nadored him, saying: Lord, my daughter is even\nnow dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and\nshe shall live.\n19 And Jesus rising up followed him, with his\ndisciples.\n20 And behold a woman who was troubled\nwith an issue of blood twelve years, came behind\nhim, and touched the hem of his garment.\n21 For she said within herself: If I shall touch\nonly his garment, I shall be healed.\n22 But Jesus turning and seeing her, said: Be\nof good heart, daughter, thy faith hath made\nthee whole. And the woman was made whole\nfrom that hour.\n23 And when Jesus was come into the house\nof the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making a rout,\n24 He said: Give place, for the girl is not dead,\nbut sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.\n25 And when the multitude was put forth, he\nwent in, and took her by the hand. And the\nmaid arose.\n26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all\nthat country.\n27 And as Jesus passed from thence, there followed him two blind men crying out and saying,\nHave mercy on us, O Son of David.\n28 And when he was come to the house, the\nblind men came to him. And Jesus saith to\nthem, Do you believe, that I can do this unto\nyou? They say to him, Yea, Lord.\n29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it done unto you.\n30 And their eyes were opened, and Jesus\nstrictly charged them, saying, See that no man\nknow this.\n31 But they going out, spread his fame abroad\nin all that country.\n32 And when they were gone out, behold they\nbrought him a dumb man, possessed with a devil.\n33 And after the devil was cast out, the dumb\nman spoke, and the multitudes wondered, saying, Never was the like seen in Israel.\n34 But the Pharisees said, By the prince of\ndevils he casteth out devils.\n35 And Jesus went about all the cities, and\ntowns, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every\ndisease, and every infirmity.\n36 And seeing the multitudes, he had compassion on them: because they were distressed, and\nlying like sheep that have no shepherd.\n37 Then he saith to his disciples, The harvest\nindeed is great, but the labourers are few.\n38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,\nthat he send forth labourers into his harvest.\n\nChapter 10\nAnd having called his twelve disciples together,\nhe gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast\nthem out, and to heal all manner of diseases, and\nall manner of infirmities.\n2 And the names of the twelve apostles are\nthese: The first, Simon who is called Peter, and\nAndrew his brother,\n3 James the son of Zebedee, and John his\nbrother, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and\nMatthew the publican, and James the son of\nAlpheus, and Thaddeus,\n4 Simon the Cananean, and Judas Iscariot,\nwho also betrayed him.\n5 These twelve Jesus sent: commanding them,\nsaying: Go ye not into the way of the Gentiles,\nand into the city of the Samaritans enter ye not.\n6 But go ye rather to the lost sheep of the\nhouse of Israel.\n7 And going, preach, saying: The kingdom of\nheaven is at hand.\n8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the\nlepers, cast out devils: freely have you received,\nfreely give.\n9 Do not possess gold, nor silver, nor money\nin your purses:\n10 Nor scrip for your journey, nor two coats,\nnor shoes, nor a staff; for the workman is worthy\nof his meat.\n11 And into whatsoever city or town you shall\nenter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there abide\ntill you go thence.\n12 And when you come into the house, salute\nit, saying: Peace be to this house.\n13 And if that house be worthy, your peace\nshall come upon it; but if it be not worthy, your\npeace shall return to you.\n14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor\nhear your words: going forth out of that house\nor city shake off the dust from your feet.\n15 Amen I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the\nday of judgment, than for that city.\n16 Behold I send you as sheep in the midst\nof wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents and\nsimple as doves.\n17 But beware of men. For they will deliver\nyou up in councils, and they will scourge you in\ntheir synagogues.\n18 And you shall be brought before governors,\nand before kings for my sake, for a testimony to\nthem and to the Gentiles:\n19 But when they shall deliver you up, take\nno thought how or what to speak: for it shall be\ngiven you in that hour what to speak.\n20 For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit\nof your Father that speaketh in you.\n21 The brother also shall deliver up the\nbrother to death, and the father the son: and\nthe children shall rise up against their parents,\nand shall put them to death.\n22 And you shall be hated by all men for my\nname\u2019s sake: but he that shall persevere unto\nthe end, he shall be saved.\n23 And when they shall persecute you in this\ncity, flee into another. Amen I say to you, you\nshall not finish all the cities of Israel, till the Son\nof man come.\n24 The disciple is not above the master, nor\nthe servant above his lord.\n25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as\nhis master, and the servant as his lord. If they\nhave called the goodman of the house Beelzebub,\nhow much more them of his household?\n26 Therefore fear them not. For nothing is\ncovered that shall not be revealed: nor hid, that\nshall not be known.\n27 That which I tell you in the dark, speak ye\nin the light: and that which you hear in the ear,\npreach ye upon the housetops.\n28 And fear ye not them that kill the body,\nand are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear\nhim that can destroy both soul and body in hell.\n29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?\nand not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father.\n30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\n31 Fear not therefore: better are you than\nmany sparrows.\n32 Every one therefore that shall confess me\nbefore men, I will also confess him before my\nFather who is in heaven.\n33 But he that shall deny me before men, I\nwill also deny him before my Father who is in\nheaven.\n34 Do not think that I came to send peace\nupon earth: I came not to send peace, but the\nsword.\n35 For I came to set a man at variance against\nhis father, and the daughter against her mother,\nand the daughter in law against her mother in\nlaw.\n36 And as a man\u2019s enemies shall be they of\nhis own household.\n37 He that loveth father or mother more than\nme, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son\nor daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.\n38 And he that taketh not up his cross, and\nfolloweth me, is not worthy of me.\n39 He that findeth his life, shall lose it: and\nhe that shall lose his life for me, shall find it.\n40 He that receiveth you, receiveth me: and\nhe that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.\n41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of\na prophet, shall receive the reward of a prophet:\nand he that receiveth a just man in the name\nof a just man, shall receive the reward of a just\nman.\n42 And whosoever shall give to drink to one of\nthese little ones a cup of cold water only in the\nname of a disciple, amen I say to you, he shall\nnot lose his reward.\n\nChapter 11\nAnd it came to pass, when Jesus had made\nan end of commanding his twelve disciples, he\npassed from thence, to teach and preach in their\ncities.\n2 Now when John had heard in prison the\nworks of Christ: sending two of his disciples he\nsaid to him:\n3 Art thou he that art to come, or look we for\nanother?\n4 And Jesus making answer said to them: Go\nand relate to John what you have heard and seen.\n5 The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are\ncleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, the\npoor have the gospel preached to them.\n6 And blessed is he that shall not be scandalized in me.\n7 And when they went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John:\nWhat went you out into the desert to see? a\nreed shaken with the wind?\n8 But what went you out to see? a man\nclothed in soft garments? Behold they that are\nclothed in soft garments, are in the houses of\nkings.\n9 But what went you out to see? a prophet?\nyea I tell you, and more than a prophet.\n10 For this is he of whom it is written: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall\nprepare thy way before thee.\n11 Amen I say to you, there hath not risen\namong them that are born of women a greater\nthan John the Baptist: yet he that is the lesser\nin the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\n12 And from the days of John the Baptist until\nnow, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence,\nand the violent bear it away.\n13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied\nuntil John:\n14 And if you will receive it, he is Elias that\nis to come.\n15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n16 But whereunto shall I esteem this generation to be like? It is like to children sitting in\nthe market place.\n17 Who crying to their companions say: We\nhave piped to you, and you have not danced: we\nhave lamented, and you have not mourned.\n18 For John came neither eating nor drinking;\nand they say: He hath a devil.\n19 The Son of man came eating and drinking,\nand they say: Behold a man that is a glutton and\na wine drinker, a friend of publicans and sinners.\nAnd wisdom is justified by her children.\n20 Then began he to upbraid the cities\nwherein were done the most of his miracles, for\nthat they had not done penance.\n21 Woe to thee, Corozain, woe to thee, Bethsaida: for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought\nthe miracles that have been wrought in you,\nthey had long ago done penance in sackcloth and\nashes.\n22 But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment,\nthan for you.\n23 And thou Capharnaum, shalt thou be exalted up to heaven? thou shalt go down even\nunto hell. For if in Sodom had been wrought the\nmiracles that have been wrought in thee, perhaps\nit had remained unto this day.\n24 But I say unto you, that it shall be more\ntolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of\njudgment, than for thee.\n25 At that time Jesus answered and said: I\nconfess to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and\nearth, because thou hast hid these things from\nthe wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to\nthe little ones.\n26 Yea, Father; for so hath it seemed good in\nthy sight.\n27 All things are delivered to me by my Father. And no one knoweth the Son, but the Father: neither doth any one know the Father, but\nthe Son, and he to whom it shall please the Son\nto reveal him.\n28 Come to me, all you that labour, and are\nburdened, and I will refresh you.\n29 Take up my yoke upon you, and learn of\nme, because I am meek, and humble of heart:\nand you shall find rest to your souls.\n30 For my yoke is sweet and my burden light.\n\nChapter 12\nAt that time Jesus went through the corn on the\nsabbath: and his disciples being hungry, began\nto pluck the ears, and to eat.\n2 And the Pharisees seeing them, said to him:\nBehold thy disciples do that which is not lawful\nto do on the sabbath days.\n3 But he said to them: Have you not read\nwhat David did when he was hungry, and they\nthat were with him:\n4 How he entered into the house of God, and\ndid eat the loaves of proposition, which it was\nnot lawful for him to eat, nor for them that were\nwith him, but for the priests only?\n5 Or have ye not read in the law, that on the\nsabbath days the priests in the temple break the\nsabbath, and are without blame?\n6 But I tell you that there is here a greater\nthan the temple.\n7 And if you knew what this meaneth: I will\nhave mercy, and not sacrifice: you would never\nhave condemned the innocent.\n8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.\n9 And when he has passed from thence, he\ncame into their synagogues.\n10 And behold there was a man who had a\nwithered hand, and they asked him, saying: Is\nit lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they\nmight accuse him.\n11 But he said to them: What man shall there\nbe among you, that hath one sheep: and if the\nsame fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he\nnot take hold on it and lift it up?\n12 How much better is a man than a sheep?\nTherefore it it lawful to do a good deed on the\nsabbath days.\n13 Then he saith to the man: Stretch forth\nthy hand; and he stretched it forth, and it was\nrestored to health even as the other.\n14 And the Pharisees going out made a consultation against him, how they might destroy\nhim.\n15 But Jesus knowing it, retired from thence:\nand many followed him, and he healed them all.\n16 And he charged them that they should not\nmake him known.\n17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken\nby Isaias the prophet, saying:\n18 Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my\nbeloved in whom my soul hath been well pleased.\nI will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew\njudgment to the Gentiles.\n19 He shall not contend, nor cry out, neither\nshall any man hear his voice in the streets.\n20 The bruised reed he shall not break: and\nsmoking flax he shall not extinguish: till he send\nforth judgment unto victory.\n21 And in his name the Gentiles shall hope.\n22 Then was offered to him one possessed with\na devil, blind and dumb: and he healed him, so\nthat he spoke and saw.\n23 And all the multitudes were amazed, and\nsaid: Is not this the son of David?\n24 But the Pharisees hearing it, said: This\nman casteth not out the devils but by Beelzebub\nthe prince of the devils.\n25 And Jesus knowing their thoughts, said to\nthem: Every kingdom divided against itself shall\nbe made desolate: and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.\n26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself: how then shall his kingdom stand?\n27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by\nwhom do your children cast them out? Therefore\nthey shall be your judges.\n28 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils,\nthen is the kingdom of God come upon you.\n29 Or how can any one enter into the house\nof the strong, and rifle his goods, unless he first\nbind the strong? and then he will rifle his house.\n30 He that is not with me, is against me: and\nhe that gathereth not with me, scattereth.\n31 Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy\nof the Spirit shall not be forgiven.\n32 And whosoever shall speak a word against\nthe Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but he\nthat shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall\nnot be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in\nthe world to come.\n33 Either make the tree good and its fruit\ngood: or make the tree evil, and its fruit evil.\nFor by the fruit the tree is known.\n34 O generation of vipers, how can you speak\ngood things, whereas you are evil? for out of the\nabundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\n35 A good man out of a good treasure bringeth\nforth good things: and an evil man out of an evil\ntreasure bringeth forth evil things.\n36 But I say unto you, that every idle word\nthat men shall speak, they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment.\n37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified,\nand by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\n38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master we would see a sign\nfrom thee.\n39 Who answering said to them: An evil and\nadulterous generation seeketh a sign: and a sign\nshall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the\nprophet.\n40 For as Jonas was in the whale\u2019s belly three\ndays and three nights: so shall the Son of man\nbe in the heart of the earth three days and three\nnights.\n41 The men of Ninive shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn\nit: because they did penance at the preaching of\nJonas. And behold a greater than Jonas here.\n42 The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn\nit: because she came from the ends of the earth\nto hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a\ngreater than Solomon here.\n43 And when an unclean spirit is gone out of a\nman he walketh through dry places seeking rest,\nand findeth none.\n44 Then he saith: I will return into my house\nfrom whence I came out. And coming he findeth\nit empty, swept, and garnished.\n45 Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven\nother spirits more wicked than himself, and they\nenter in and dwell there: and the last state of\nthat man in made worse than the first. So shall\nit be also to this wicked generation.\n46 As he was yet speaking to the multitudes,\nbehold his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.\n47 And one said unto him: Behold thy mother\nand thy brethren stand without, seeking thee.\n48 But he answering him that told him, said:\nWho is my mother, and who are my brethren?\n49 And stretching forth his hand towards his\ndisciples, he said: Behold my mother and my\nbrethren.\n50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father, that is in heaven, he is my brother, and\nsister, and mother.\n\nChapter 13\nThe same day Jesus going out of the house, sat\nby the sea side.\n2 And great multitudes were gathered unto\nhim, so that he went up into a boat and sat:\nand all the multitude stood on the shore.\n3 And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying: Behold the sower went forth to sow.\n4 And whilst he soweth some fell by the way\nside, and the birds of the air came and ate them\nup.\n5 And other some fell upon stony ground,\nwhere they had not much earth: and they sprung\nup immediately, because they had no deepness of\nearth.\n6 And when the sun was up they were\nscorched: and because they had not root, they\nwithered away.\n7 And others fell among thorns: and the\nthorns grew up and choked them.\n8 And others fell upon good ground: and they\nbrought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some\nsixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.\n9 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n10 And his disciples came and said to him:\nWhy speakest thou to them in parables?\n11 Who answered and said to them: Because\nto you it is given to know the mysteries of the\nkingdom of heaven: but to them it is not given.\n12 For he that hath, to him shall be given,\nand he shall abound: but he that hath not, from\nhim shall be taken away that also which he hath.\n13 Therefore do I speak to them in parables:\nbecause seeing they see not, and hearing they\nhear not, neither do they understand.\n14 And the prophecy of Isaias is fulfilled in\nthem, who saith: By hearing you shall hear, and\nshall not understand: and seeing you shall see,\nand shall not perceive.\n15 For the heart of this people is grown gross,\nand with their ears they have been dull of hearing, and their eyes they have shut: lest at any\ntime they should see with their eyes, and hear\nwith their ears, and understand with their heart,\nand be converted, and I should heal them.\n16 But blessed are your eyes, because they see,\nand your ears, because they hear.\n17 For, amen, I say to you, many prophets\nand just men have desired to see the things that\nyou see, and have not seen them, and to hear the\nthings that you hear and have not heard them.\n18 Hear you therefore the parable of the sower.\n19 When any one heareth the word of\nthe kingdom, and understandeth it not, there\ncometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that\nwhich was sown in his heart: this is he that received the seed by the way side.\n20 And he that received the seed upon stony\nground, is he that heareth the word, and immediately receiveth it with joy.\n21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but is\nonly for a time: and when there ariseth tribulation and persecution because of the word, he\nis presently scandalized.\n22 And he that received the seed among\nthorns, is he that heareth the word, and the\ncare of this world and the deceitfulness of riches\nchoketh up the word, and he becometh fruitless.\n23 But he that received the seed upon good\nground, is he that heareth the word, and understandeth, and beareth fruit, and yieldeth the one\nan hundredfold, and another sixty, and another\nthirty.\n24 Another parable he proposed to them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man\nthat sowed good seeds in his field.\n25 But while men were asleep, his enemy came\nand oversowed cockle among the wheat and went\nhis way.\n26 And when the blade was sprung up, and\nhad brought forth fruit, then appeared also the\ncockle.\n27 And the servants of the goodman of the\nhouse coming said to him: Sir, didst thou not\nsow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it\ncockle?\n28 And he said to them: An enemy hath done\nthis. And the servants said to him: Wilt thou\nthat we go and gather it up?\n29 And he said: No, lest perhaps gathering up\nthe cockle, you root up the wheat also together\nwith it.\n30 Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and\nin the time of the harvest I will say to the\nreapers: Gather up first the cockle, and bind\nit into bundles to burn, but the wheat gather ye\ninto my barn.\n31 Another parable he proposed unto them,\nsaying: The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain\nof mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in\nhis field.\n32 Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but\nwhen it is grown up, it is greater than all herbs,\nand becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air\ncome, and dwell in the branches thereof.\n33 Another parable he spoke to them: The\nkingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a\nwoman took and hid in three measures of meal,\nuntil the whole was leavened.\n34 All these things Jesus spoke in parables to\nthe multitudes: and without parables he did not\nspeak to them.\n35 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken\nby the prophet, saying: I will open my mouth\nin parables, I will utter things hidden from the\nfoundation of the world.\n36 Then having sent away the multitudes, he\ncame into the house, and his disciples came to\nhim, saying: Expound to us the parable of the\ncockle of the field.\n37 Who made answer and said to them: He\nthat soweth the good seed, is the Son of man.\n38 And the field, is the world. And the good\nseed are the children of the kingdom. And the\ncockle, are the children of the wicked one.\n39 And the enemy that sowed them, is the\ndevil. But the harvest is the end of the world.\nAnd the reapers are the angels.\n40 Even as cockle therefore is gathered up,\nand burnt with fire: so shall it be at the end of\nthe world.\n41 The Son of man shall send his angels, and\nthey shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals,\nand them that work iniquity.\n42 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire:\nthere shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n43 Then shall the just shine as the sun, in the\nkingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to\nhear, let him hear.\n44 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field. Which a man having\nfound, hid it, and for joy thereof goeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\n45 Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a\nmerchant seeking good pearls.\n46 Who when he had found one pearl of great\nprice, went his way, and sold all that he had, and\nbought it.\n47 Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a\nnet cast into the sea, and gathering together of\nall kind of fishes.\n48 Which, when it was filled, they drew out,\nand sitting by the shore, they chose out the good\ninto vessels, but the bad they cast forth.\n49 So shall it be at the end of the world. The\nangels shall go out, and shall separate the wicked\nfrom among the just.\n50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire:\nthere shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n51 Have ye understood all these things? They\nsay to him: Yes.\n52 He said unto them: Therefore every scribe\ninstructed in the kingdom of heaven, is like to a\nman that is a householder, who bringeth forth\nout of his treasure new things and old.\n53 And it came to pass: when Jesus had finished these parables, he passed from thence.\n54 And coming into his own country, he\ntaught them in their synagogues, so that they\nwondered and said: How came this man by this\nwisdom and miracles?\n55 Is not this the carpenter\u2019s son? Is not his\nmother called Mary, and his brethren James, and\nJoseph, and Simon, and Jude:\n56 And his sisters, are they not all with us?\nWhence therefore hath he all these things?\n57 And they were scandalized in his regard.\nBut Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without\nhonour, save in his own country, and in his own\nhouse.\n58 And he wrought not many miracles there,\nbecause of their unbelief.\n\nChapter 14\nAt the time Herod the Tetrarch heard the fame\nof Jesus.\n2 And he said to his servants: This is John the\nBaptist: he is risen from the dead, and therefore\nmighty works shew forth themselves in him.\n3 For Herod had apprehended John and bound\nhim, and put him into prison, because of Herodias, his brother\u2019s wife.\n4 For John said to him: It is not lawful for\nthee to have her.\n5 And having a mind to put him to death, he\nfeared the people: because they esteemed him as\na prophet.\n6 But on Herod\u2019s birthday, the daughter\nof Herodias danced before them: and pleased\nHerod.\n7 Whereupon he promised with an oath, to\ngive her whatsoever she would ask of him.\n8 But she being instructed before by her\nmother, said: Give me here in a dish the head of\nJohn the Baptist.\n9 And the king was struck sad: yet because\nof his oath, and for them that sat with him at\ntable, he commanded it to be given.\n10 And he sent, and beheaded John in the\nprison.\n11 And his head was brought in a dish: and\nit was given to the damsel, and she brought it to\nher mother.\n12 And his disciples came and took the body,\nand buried it, and came and told Jesus.\n13 Which when Jesus had heard, he retired\nfrom thence by boat, into a desert place apart,\nand the multitudes having heard of it, followed\nhim on foot out of the cities.\n14 And he coming forth saw a great multitude,\nand had compassion on them, and healed their\nsick.\n15 And when it was evening, his disciples\ncame to him, saying: This is a desert place, and\nthe hour is now past: send away the multitudes,\nthat going into the towns, they may buy themselves victuals.\n16 But Jesus said to them, They have no need\nto go: give you them to eat.\n17 They answered him: We have not here, but\nfive loaves, and two fishes.\n18 He said to them: Bring them hither to me.\n19 And when he had commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the grass, he took the\nfive loaves and the two fishes, and looking up\nto heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the\nloaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the\nmultitudes.\n20 And they did all eat, and were filled. And\nthey took up what remained, twelve full baskets\nof fragments.\n21 And the number of them that did eat, was\nfive thousand men, besides women and children.\n22 And forthwith Jesus obliged his disciples to\ngo up into the boat, and to go before him over\nthe water, till he dismissed the people.\n23 And having dismissed the multitude, he\nwent into a mountain alone to pray. And when\nit was evening, he was there alone.\n24 But the boat in the midst of the sea was\ntossed with the waves: for the wind was contrary.\n25 And in the fourth watch of the night, he\ncame to them walking upon the sea.\n26 And they seeing him walk upon the sea,\nwere troubled, saying: It is an apparition. And\nthey cried out for fear.\n27 And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying: Be of good heart: it is I, fear ye not.\n28 And Peter making answer, said: Lord, if it\nbe thou, bid me come to thee upon the waters.\n29 And he said: Come. And Peter going down\nout of the boat, walked upon the water to come\nto Jesus.\n30 But seeing the wind strong, he was afraid:\nand when he began to sink, he cried out, saying:\nLord, save me.\n31 And immediately Jesus stretching forth his\nhand took hold of him, and said to him: O thou\nof little faith, why didst thou doubt?\n32 And when they were come up into the boat,\nthe wind ceased.\n33 And they that were in the boat came and\nadored him, saying: Indeed thou art the Son of\nGod.\n34 And having passed the water, they came\ninto the country of Genesar.\n35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent into all that country, and\nbrought to him all that were diseased.\n36 And they besought him that they might\ntouch but the hem of his garment. And as many\nas touched, were made whole.\n\nChapter 15\nThen came to him from Jerusalem scribes and\nPharisees, saying:\n2 Why do thy disciples trangress the tradition\nof the ancients? For they wash not their hands\nwhen they eat bread.\n3 But he answering, said to them: Why do\nyou also transgress the commandment of God\nfor your tradition? For God said:\n4 Honour thy father and mother: And: He\nthat shall curse father or mother, let him die the\ndeath.\n5 But you say: Whosoever shall say to father\nor mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from\nme, shall profit thee.\n6 And he shall not honour his father or his\nmother: and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition.\n7 Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of\nyou, saying:\n8 This people honoureth me with their lips:\nbut their heart is far from me.\n9 And in vain do they worship me, teaching\ndoctrines and commandments of men.\n10 And having called together the multitudes\nunto him, he said to them: Hear ye and understand.\n11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but what cometh out of the mouth,\nthis defileth a man.\n12 Then came his disciples, and said to him:\nDost thou know that the Pharisees, when they\nheard this word, were scandalized?\n13 But he answering them, said: Every plant\nwhich my heavenly Father hath not planted,\nshall be rooted up.\n14 Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders\nof the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both\nwill fall into the pit.\n15 And Peter answering, said to him: Expound to us this parable.\n16 But he said: Are you also yet without understanding?\n17 Do you not understand, that whatsoever\nentereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly,\nand is cast out into the privy?\n18 But the things which proceed out of the\nmouth, come forth from the heart, and those\nthings defile a man.\n19 For from the heart come forth evil\nthoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,\nthefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.\n20 These are the things that defile a man. But\nto eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a\nman.\n21 And Jesus went from thence, and retired\ninto the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.\n22 And behold a woman of Canaan who came\nout of those coasts, crying out, said to him: Have\nmercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my\ndaughter is grieviously troubled by the devil.\n23 Who answered her not a word. And his\ndisciples came and besought him, saying: Send\nher away, for she crieth after us:\n24 And he answering, said: I was not sent but\nto the sheep that are lost of the house of Israel.\n25 But she came and adored him, saying:\nLord, help me.\n26 Who answering, said: It is not good to take\nthe bread of the children, and to cast it to the\ndogs.\n27 But she said: Yea, Lord; for the whelps\nalso eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of\ntheir masters.\n28 Then Jesus answering, said to her: O\nwoman, great is thy faith: be it done to thee\nas thou wilt: and her daughter was cured from\nthat hour.\n29 And when Jesus had passed away from\nthence, he came nigh the sea of Galilee. And\ngoing up into a mountain, he sat there.\n30 And there came to him great multitudes,\nhaving with them the dumb, the blind, the lame,\nthe maimed, and many others: and they cast\nthem down at his feet, and he healed them:\n31 So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the\ndumb speak, the lame walk, and the blind see:\nand they glorified the God of Israel.\n32 And Jesus called together his disciples, and\nsaid: I have compassion on the multitudes, because they continue with me now three days, and\nhave not what to eat, and I will not send them\naway fasting, lest they faint in the way.\n33 And the disciples say unto him: Whence\nthen should we have so many loaves in the desert,\nas to fill so great a multitude?\n34 And Jesus said to them: How many loaves\nhave you? But they said: Seven, and a few little\nfishes.\n35 And he commanded the multitude to sit\ndown upon the ground.\n36 And taking the seven loaves and the fishes,\nand giving thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the people.\n37 And they did all eat, and had their fill.\nAnd they took up seven baskets full, of what\nremained of the fragments.\n38 And they that did eat, were four thousand\nmen, beside children and women.\n39 And having dismissed the multitude, he\nwent up into a boat, and came into the coasts of\nMagedan.\n\nChapter 16\nAnd there came to him the Pharisees and Sadduccees tempting: and they asked him to shew\nthem a sign from heaven.\n2 But he answered and said to them: When\nit is evening, you say, It will be fair weather, for\nthe sky is red.\n3 And in the morning: To day there will be a\nstorm, for the sky is red and lowering. You know\nthen how to discern the face of the sky: and can\nyou not know the signs of the times?\n4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh\nafter a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but\nthe sign of Jonas the prophet. And he left them,\nand went away.\n5 And when his disciples were come over the\nwater, they had forgotten to take bread.\n6 Who said to them: Take heed and beware\nof the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\n7 But they thought within themselves, saying:\nBecause we have taken no bread.\n8 And Jesus knowing it, said: Why do you\nthink within yourselves, O ye of little faith, for\nthat you have no bread?\n9 Do you not yet understand, neither do you\nremember the five loaves among five thousand\nmen, and how many baskets you took up?\n10 Nor the seven loaves among four thousand\nmen, and how many baskets you took up?\n11 Why do you not understand that it was\nnot concerning the bread I said to you: Beware\nof the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?\n12 Then they understood that he said not that\nthey should beware of the leaven of bread, but\nof the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\n13 And Jesus came into the quarters of Cesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples, saying:\nWhom do men say that the Son of man is?\n14 But they said: Some John the Baptist, and\nother some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of\nthe prophets.\n15 Jesus saith to them: But whom do you say\nthat I am?\n16 Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art\nChrist, the Son of the living God.\n17 And Jesus answering, said to him: Blessed\nart thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and\nblood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father\nwho is in heaven.\n18 And I say to thee: That thou art Peter;\nand upon this rock I will build my church, and\nthe gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\n19 And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind\nupon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and\nwhatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall\nbe loosed also in heaven.\n20 Then he commanded his disciples, that\nthey should tell no one that he was Jesus the\nChrist.\n21 From that time Jesus began to shew to\nhis disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and\nsuffer many things from the ancients and scribes\nand chief priests, and be put to death, and the\nthird day rise again.\n22 And Peter taking him, began to rebuke\nhim, saying: Lord, be it far from thee, this shall\nnot be unto thee.\n23 Who turning, said to Peter: Go behind me,\nSatan, thou art a scandal unto me: because thou\nsavourest not the things that are of God, but the\nthings that are of men.\n24 Then Jesus said to his disciples: If any\nman will come after me, let him deny himself,\nand take up his cross, and follow me.\n25 For he that will save his life, shall lose it:\nand he that shall lose his life for my sake, shall\nfind it.\n26 For what doth it profit a man, if he gain\nthe whole world, and suffer the loss of his own\nsoul? Or what exchange shall a man give for his\nsoul?\n27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory\nof his Father with his angels: and then will he\nrender to every man according to his works.\n28 Amen I say to you, there are some of them\nthat stand here, that shall not taste death, till\nthey see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.\n\nChapter 17\nAnd after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter\nand James, and John his brother, and bringeth\nthem up into a high mountain apart:\n2 And he was transfigured before them. And\nhis face did shine as the sun: and his garments\nbecame white as snow.\n3 And behold there appeared to them Moses\nand Elias talking with him.\n4 And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Lord,\nit is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us\nmake here three tabernacles, one for thee, and\none for Moses, and one for Elias.\n5 And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright\ncloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out\nof the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in\nwhom I am well pleased: hear ye him.\n6 And the disciples hearing, fell upon their\nface, and were very much afraid.\n7 And Jesus came and touched them: and said\nto them, Arise, and fear not.\n8 And they lifting up their eyes saw no one\nbut only Jesus.\n9 And as they came down from the mountain,\nJesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no\nman, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.\n10 And his disciples asked him, saying: Why\nthen do the scribes say that Elias must come\nfirst?\n11 But he answering, said to them: Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things.\n12 But I say to you, that Elias is already come,\nand they knew him not, but have done unto him\nwhatsoever they had a mind. So also the Son of\nman shall suffer from them.\n13 Then the disciples understood, that he had\nspoken to them of John the Baptist.\n14 And when he was come to the multitude,\nthere came to him a man falling down on his\nknees before him, saying: Lord, have pity on my\nson, for he is a lunatic, and suffereth much: for\nhe falleth often into the fire, and often into the\nwater.\n15 And I brought him to thy disciples, and\nthey could not cure him.\n16 Then Jesus answered and said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I\nbe with you? How long shall I suffer you? bring\nhim hither to me.\n17 And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil went\nout of him, and the child was cured from that\nhour.\n18 Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly,\nand said: Why could not we cast him out?\n19 Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For, amen I say to you, if you have faith\nas a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to\nthis mountain, Remove from hence hither, and\nit shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible\nto you.\n20 But this kind is not cast out but by prayer\nand fasting.\n21 And when they abode together in Galilee,\nJesus said to them: The Son of man shall be\nbetrayed into the hands of men:\n22 And they shall kill him, and the third day\nhe shall rise again. And they were troubled exceedingly.\n23 And when they were come to Capharnaum,\nthey that recieved the didrachmas, came to Peter\nand said to him: Doth not your master pay the\ndidrachmas?\n24 He said: Yes. And when he was come into\nthe house, Jesus prevented him, saying: What\nis thy opinion, Simon? The kings of the earth,\nof whom do they receive tribute or custom? of\ntheir own children, or of strangers?\n25 And he said: Of strangers. Jesus said to\nhim: Then the children are free.\n26 But that we may not scandalize them, go\nto the sea, and cast in a hook: and that fish\nwhich shall first come up, take: and when thou\nhast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater:\ntake that, and give it to them for me and thee.\n\nChapter 18\nAt that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying:\nWho thinkest thou is the greater in the kingdom\nof heaven?\n2 And Jesus calling unto him a little child, set\nhim in the midst of them,\n3 And said: Amen I say to you, unless you\nbe converted, and become as little children, you\nshall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as\nthis little child, he is the greater in the kingdom\nof heaven.\n5 And he that shall receive one such little child\nin my name, receiveth me.\n6 But he that shall scandalize one of these\nlittle ones that believe in me, it were better for\nhim that a millstone should be hanged about\nhis neck, and that he should be drowned in the\ndepth of the sea.\n7 Woe to the world because of scandals. For\nit must needs be that scandals come: but nevertheless woe to that man by whom the scandal\ncometh.\n8 And if thy hand, or thy foot scandalize thee,\ncut it off, and cast it from thee. It is better for\nthee to go into life maimed or lame, than having\ntwo hands or two feet, to be cast into everlasting\nfire.\n9 And if thy eye scandalize thee, pluck it out,\nand cast it from thee. It is better for thee having\none eye to enter into life, than having two eyes\nto be cast into hell fire.\n10 See that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say to you, that their angels in\nheaven always see the face of my Father who is\nin heaven.\n11 For the Son of man is come to save that\nwhich was lost.\n12 What think you? If a man have an hundred\nsheep, and one of them should go astray: doth\nhe not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains,\nand go to seek that which is gone astray?\n13 And if it so be that he find it: Amen I say\nto you, he rejoiceth more for that, than for the\nninety-nine that went not astray.\n14 Even so it is not the will of your Father,\nwho is in heaven, that one of these little ones\nshould perish.\n15 But if thy brother shall offend against thee,\ngo, and rebuke him between thee and him alone.\nIf he shall hear thee, thou shalt gain thy brother.\n16 And if he will not hear thee, take with thee\none or two more: that in the mouth of two or\nthree witnesses every word may stand.\n17 And if he will not hear them: tell the\nchurch. And if he will not hear the church, let\nhim be to thee as the heathen and publican.\n18 Amen I say to you, whatsoever you shall\nbind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven;\nand whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall\nbe loosed also in heaven.\n19 Again I say to you, that if two of you shall\nconsent upon earth, concerning any thing whatsoever they shall ask, it shall be done to them\nby my Father who is in heaven.\n20 For where there are two or three gathered\ntogether in my name, there am I in the midst of\nthem.\n21 Then came Peter unto him and said: Lord,\nhow often shall my brother offend against me,\nand I forgive him? till seven times?\n22 Jesus saith to him: I say not to thee, till\nseven times; but till seventy times seven times.\n23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened\nto a king, who would take an account of his servants.\n24 And when he had begun to take the account, one was brought to him, that owed him\nten thousand talents.\n25 And as he had not wherewith to pay it,\nhis lord commanded that he should be sold, and\nhis wife and children and all that he had, and\npayment to be made.\n26 But that servant falling down, besought\nhim, saying: Have patience with me, and I will\npay thee all.\n27 And the lord of that servant being moved\nwith pity, let him go and forgave him the debt.\n28 But when that servant was gone out, he\nfound one of his fellow servants that owed him an\nhundred pence: and laying hold of him, throttled\nhim, saying: Pay what thou owest.\n29 And his fellow servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and\nI will pay thee all.\n30 And he would not: but went and cast him\ninto prison, till he paid the debt.\n31 Now his fellow servants seeing what was\ndone, were very much grieved, and they came\nand told their lord all that was done.\n32 Then his lord called him; and said to him:\nThou wicked servant, I forgave thee all the debt,\nbecause thou besoughtest me:\n33 Shouldst not thou then have had compassion also on thy fellow servant, even as I had\ncompassion on thee?\n34 And his lord being angry, delivered him to\nthe torturers until he paid all the debt.\n35 So also shall my heavenly Father do to you,\nif you forgive not every one his brother from your\nhearts.\n\nChapter 19\nAnd it came to pass when Jesus had ended these\nwords, he departed from Galilee, and came into\nthe coasts of Judea, beyond Jordan.\n2 And great multitudes followed him: and he\nhealed them there.\n3 And there came to him the Pharisees tempting him, and saying: Is it lawful for a man to put\naway his wife for every cause?\n4 Who answering, said to them: Have ye not\nread, that he who made man from the beginning,\nMade them male and female? And he said:\n5 For this cause shall a man leave father and\nmother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they\ntwo shall be in one flesh.\n6 Therefore now they are not two, but one\nflesh. What therefore God hath joined together,\nlet no man put asunder.\n7 They say to him: Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorce, and to put away?\n8 He saith to them: Because Moses by reason\nof the hardness of your heart permitted you to\nput away your wives: but from the beginning it\nwas not so.\n9 And I say to you, that whosoever shall put\naway his wife, except it be for fornication, and\nshall marry another, committeth adultery: and\nhe that shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.\n10 His disciples say unto him: If the case of\na man with his wife be so, it is not expedient to\nmarry.\n11 Who said to them: All men take not this\nword, but they to whom it is given.\n12 For there are eunuchs, who were born so\nfrom their mother\u2019s womb: and there are eunuchs, who were made so by men: and there are\neunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for\nthe kingdom of heaven. He that can take, let\nhim take it.\n13 Then were little children presented to him,\nthat he should impose hands upon them and\npray. And the disciples rebuked them.\n14 But Jesus said to them: Suffer the little\nchildren, and forbid them not to come to me:\nfor the kingdom of heaven is for such.\n15 And when he had imposed hands upon\nthem, he departed from thence.\n16 And behold one came and said to him:\nGood master, what good shall I do that I may\nhave life everlasting?\n17 Who said to him: Why asketh thou me\nconcerning good? One is good, God. But if thou\nwilt enter into life, keep the commandments.\n18 He said to him: Which? And Jesus said:\nThou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit\nadultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not\nbear false witness.\n19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and,\nThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\n20 The young man saith to him: All these I\nhave kept from my youth, what is yet wanting\nto me?\n21 Jesus saith to him: If thou wilt be perfect,\ngo sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and\nthou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come\nfollow me.\n22 And when the young man had heard this\nword, he went away sad: for he had great possessions.\n23 Then Jesus said to his disciples: Amen, I\nsay to you, that a rich man shall hardly enter\ninto the kingdom of heaven.\n24 And again I say to you: It is easier for\na camel to pass through the eye of a needle,\nthan for a rich man to enter into the kingdom\nof heaven.\n25 And when they had heard this, the disciples wondered very much, saying: Who then can\nbe saved?\n26 And Jesus beholding, said to them: With\nmen this is impossible: but with God all things\nare possible.\n27 Then Peter answering, said to him: Behold\nwe have left all things, and have followed thee:\nwhat therefore shall we have?\n28 And Jesus said to them: Amen, I say to\nyou, that you, who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the\nseat of his majesty, you also shall sit on twelve\nseats judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\n29 And every one that hath left house, or\nbrethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife,\nor children, or lands for my name\u2019s sake, shall\nreceive an hundredfold, and shall possess life everlasting.\n30 And many that are first, shall be last: and\nthe last shall be first.\n\nChapter 20\nThe kingdom of heaven is like to an householder,\nwho went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.\n2 And having agreed with the labourers for a\npenny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.\n3 And going about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market place idle.\n4 And he said to them: Go you also into my\nvineyard, and I will give you what shall be just.\n5 And they went their way. And again he went\nout about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did\nin like manner.\n6 But about the eleventh hour he went out\nand found others standing, and he saith to them:\nWhy stand you here all the day idle?\n7 They say to him: Because no man hath hired\nus. He saith to them: Go you also into my vineyard.\n8 And when evening was come, the lord of the\nvineyard saith to his steward: Call the labourers\nand pay them their hire, beginning from the last\neven to the first.\n9 When therefore they were come, that came\nabout the eleventh hour, they received every\nman a penny.\n10 But when the first also came, they thought\nthat they should receive more: and they also\nreceived every man a penny.\n11 And receiving it they murmured against\nthe master of the house,\n12 Saying: These last have worked but one\nhour, and thou hast made them equal to us, that\nhave borne the burden of the day and the heats.\n13 But he answering said to one of them:\n\nFriend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree\nwith me for a penny?\n14 Take what is thine, and go thy way: I will\nalso give to this last even as to thee.\n15 Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I\nwill? is thy eye evil, because I am good?\n16 So shall the last be first, and the first last.\nFor many are called, but few chosen.\n17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the\ntwelve disciples apart, and said to them:\n18 Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the\nSon of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests\nand the scribes, and they shall condemn him to\ndeath.\n19 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to\nbe mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and the\nthird day he shall rise again.\n20 Then came to him the mother of the sons\nof Zebedee with her sons, adoring and asking\nsomething of him.\n21 Who said to her: What wilt thou? She\nsaith to him: Say that these my two sons may\nsit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on\nthy left, in thy kingdom.\n22 And Jesus answering, said: You know not\nwhat you ask. Can you drink the chalice that I\nshall drink? They say to him: We can.\n23 He saith to them: My chalice indeed you\nshall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand, is\nnot mine to give to you, but to them for whom\nit is prepared by my Father.\n24 And the ten hearing it, were moved with\nindignation against the two brethren.\n25 But Jesus called them to him, and said:\nYou know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it\nover them; and they that are the greater, exercise\npower upon them.\n26 It shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be the greater among you, let him be\nyour minister:\n27 And he that will be first among you, shall\nbe your servant.\n28 Even as the Son of man is not come to be\nministered unto, but to minister, and to give his\nlife a redemption for many.\n29 And when they went out from Jericho, a\ngreat multitude followed him.\n30 And behold two blind men sitting by the\nway side, heard that Jesus passed by, and they\ncried out, saying: O Lord, thou son of David,\nhave mercy on us.\n31 And the multitude rebuked them that they\nshould hold their peace. But they cried out the\nmore, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have\nmercy on us.\n32 And Jesus stood, and called them, and\nsaid: What will ye that I do to you?\n33 They say to him: Lord, that our eyes be\nopened.\n34 And Jesus having compassion on them,\ntouched their eyes. And immediately they saw,\nand followed him.\n\nChapter 21\nAnd when they drew nigh to Jerusalem, and\nwere come to Bethphage, unto mount Olivet,\nthen Jesus sent two disciples,\n2 Saying to them: Go ye into the village that\nis over against you, and immediately you shall\nfind an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them\nand bring them to me.\n3 And if any man shall say anything to you,\nsay ye, that the Lord hath need of them: and\nforthwith he will let them go.\n4 Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:\n5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion: Behold thy\nking cometh to thee, meek, and sitting upon an\nass, and a colt the foal of her that is used to the\nyoke.\n6 And the disciples going, did as Jesus commanded them.\n7 And they brought the ass and the colt, and\nlaid their garments upon them, and made him\nsit thereon.\n8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way: and others cut boughs from\nthe trees, and strewed them in the way:\n9 And the multitudes that went before and\nthat followed, cried, saying: Hosanna to the son\nof David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name\nof the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.\n10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, the\nwhole city was moved, saying: Who is this?\n11 And the people said: This is Jesus the\nprophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.\n12 And Jesus went into the temple of God,\nand cast out all them that sold and bought in the\ntemple, and overthrew the tables of the money\nchangers, and the chairs of them that sold doves:\n13 And he saith to them: It is written, My\nhouse shall be called the house of prayer; but\nyou have made it a den of thieves.\n14 And there came to him the blind and the\nlame in the temple; and he healed them.\n15 And the chief priests and scribes, seeing the\nwonderful things that he did, and the children\ncrying in the temple, and saying: Hosanna to\nthe son of David; were moved with indignation.\n16 And said to him: Hearest thou what these\nsay? And Jesus said to them: Yea, have you\nnever read: Out of the mouth of infants and of\nsucklings thou hast perfected praise?\n17 And leaving them, he went out of the city\ninto Bethania, and remained there.\n18 And in the morning, returning into the city,\nhe was hungry.\n19 And seeing a certain fig tree by the way\nside, he came to it, and found nothing on it but\nleaves only, and he saith to it: May no fruit grow\non thee henceforward for ever. And immediately\nthe fig tree withered away.\n20 And the disciples seeing it wondered, saying: How is it presently withered away?\n21 And Jesus answering, said to them: Amen,\nI say to you, if you shall have faith, and stagger\nnot, not only this of the fig tree shall you do, but\nalso if you shall say to this mountain, Take up\nand cast thyself into the sea, it shall be done.\n22 And in all things whatsoever you shall ask\nin prayer, believing, you shall receive.\n23 And when he was come into the temple,\nthere came to him, as he was teaching, the chief\npriests and ancients of the people, saying: By\nwhat authority dost thou these things? and who\nhath given thee this authority?\n24 Jesus answering, said to them: I also will\nask you one word, which if you shall tell me, I\nwill also tell you by what authority I do these\nthings.\n25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from\nheaven or from men? But they thought within\nthemselves, saying:\n26 If we shall say, from heaven, he will say\nto us: Why then did you not believe him? But\nif we shall say, from men, we are afraid of the\nmultitude: for all held John as a prophet.\n27 And answering Jesus, they said: We know\nnot. He also said to them: Neither do I tell you\nby what authority I do these things.\n28 But what think you? A certain man had\ntwo sons; and coming to the first, he said: Son,\ngo work to day in my vineyard.\n29 And he answering, said: I will not. But afterwards, being moved with repentance, he went.\n30 And coming to the other, he said in like\nmanner. And he answering, said: I go, Sir; and\nhe went not.\n31 Which of the two did the father\u2019s will?\nThey say to him: The first. Jesus saith to them:\nAmen I say to you, that the publicans and the\nharlots shall go into the kingdom of God before\nyou.\n32 For John came to you in the way of justice,\nand you did not believe him. But the publicans\nand the harlots believed him: but you, seeing it,\ndid not even afterwards repent, that you might\nbelieve him.\n33 Hear ye another parable. There was a man\nan householder, who planted a vineyard, and\nmade a hedge round about it, and dug in it a\npress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen; and went into a strange country.\n34 And when the time of the fruits drew nigh,\nhe sent his servants to the husbandmen that they\nmight receive the fruits thereof.\n35 And the husbandmen laying hands on\nhis servants, beat one, and killed another, and\nstoned another.\n36 Again he sent other servants more than the\nformer; and they did to them in like manner.\n37 And last of all he sent to them his son,\nsaying: They will reverence my son.\n38 But the husbandmen seeing the son, said\namong themselves: This is the heir: come, let us\nkill him, and we shall have his inheritance.\n39 And taking him, they cast him forth out of\nthe vineyard, and killed him.\n40 When therefore the lord of the vineyard\nshall come, what will he do to those husbandmen?\n41 They say to him: He will bring those evil\nmen to an evil end; and will let out his vineyard\nto other husbandmen, that shall render him the\nfruit in due season.\n42 Jesus saith to them: Have you never read\nin the Scriptures: The stone which the builders\nrejected, the same is become the head of the corner? By the Lord this has been done; and it is\nwonderful in our eyes.\n43 Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of\nGod shall be taken from you, and shall be given\nto a nation yielding the fruits thereof.\n44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall\nbe broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it\nshall grind him to powder.\n45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees\nhad heard his parables, they knew that he spoke\nof them.\n46 And seeking to lay hands on him, they\nfeared the multitudes: because they held him\nas a prophet.\n\nChapter 22\nAnd Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to\nthem, saying:\n2 The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king,\nwho made a marriage for his son.\n3 And he sent his servants, to call them that\nwere invited to the marriage; and they would not\ncome.\n4 Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell\nthem that were invited, Behold, I have prepared\nmy dinner; my beeves and fatlings are killed, and\nall things are ready: come ye to the marriage.\n5 But they neglected, and went their own\nways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise.\n6 And the rest laid hands on his servants, and\nhaving treated them contumeliously, put them\nto death.\n7 But when the king had heard of it, he was\nangry, and sending his armies, he destroyed those\nmurderers, and burnt their city.\n8 Then he saith to his servants: The marriage\nindeed is ready; but they that were invited were\nnot worthy.\n9 Go ye therefore into the highways; and as\nmany as you shall find, call to the marriage.\n10 And his servants going forth into the ways,\ngathered together all that they found, both bad\nand good: and the marriage was filled with\nguests.\n11 And the king went in to see the guests: and\nhe saw there a man who had not on a wedding\ngarment.\n12 And he saith to him: Friend, how camest\nthou in hither not having a wedding garment?\nBut he was silent.\n13 Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his\nhands and feet, and cast him into the exterior\ndarkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing\nof teeth.\n14 For many are called, but few are chosen.\n15 Then the Pharisees going, consulted among\nthemselves how to insnare him in his speech.\n16 And they sent to him their disciples with\nthe Herodians, saying: Master, we know that\nthou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of\nGod in truth, neither carest thou for any man:\nfor thou dost not regard the person of men.\n17 Tell us therefore what dost thou think, is\nit lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?\n18 But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said:\nWhy do you tempt me, ye hypocrites?\n19 Shew me the coin of the tribute. And they\noffered him a penny.\n20 And Jesus saith to them: Whose image and\ninscription is this?\n21 They say to him: Caesar\u2019s. Then he saith\nto them: Render therefore to Caesar the things\nthat are Caesar\u2019s; and to God, the things that\nare God\u2019s.\n22 And hearing this they wondered, and leaving him, went their ways.\n23 That day there came to him the Sadducees,\nwho say there is no resurrection; and asked him,\n24 Saying: Master, Moses said: If a man die\nhaving no son, his brother shall marry his wife,\nand raise up issue to his brother.\n25 Now there were with us seven brethren:\nand the first having married a wife, died; and\nnot having issue, left his wife to his brother.\n26 In like manner the second, and the third,\nand so on to the seventh.\n27 And last of all the woman died also.\n28 At the resurrection therefore whose wife of\nthe seven shall she be? for they all had her.\n29 And Jesus answering, said to them: You\nerr, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power\nof God.\n30 For in the resurrection they shall neither\nmarry nor be married; but shall be as the angels\nof God in heaven.\n31 And concerning the resurrection of the\ndead, have you not read that which was spoken\nby God, saying to you:\n32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of\nIsaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God\nof the dead, but of the living.\n33 And the multitudes hearing it, were in admiration at his doctrine.\n34 But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came together:\n35 And one of them, a doctor of the law, asking him, tempting him:\n36 Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?\n37 Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the\nLord thy God with thy whole heart, and with\nthy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.\n38 This is the greatest and the first commandment.\n39 And the second is like to this: Thou shalt\nlove thy neighbor as thyself.\n40 On these two commandments dependeth\nthe whole law and the prophets.\n41 And the Pharisees being gathered together,\nJesus asked them,\n42 Saying: What think you of Christ? whose\nson is he? They say to him: David\u2019s.\n43 He saith to them: How then doth David in\nspirit call him Lord, saying:\n44 The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right\nhand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?\n45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his\nson?\n46 And no man was able to answer him a\nword; neither durst any man from that day forth\nask him any more questions\n\nChapter 23\nThen Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his\ndisciples,\n2 Saying: The scribes and the Pharisees have\nsitten on the chair of Moses.\n3 All things therefore whatsoever they shall\nsay to you, observe and do: but according to\ntheir works do ye not; for they say, and do not.\n4 For they bind heavy and insupportable burdens, and lay them on men\u2019s shoulders; but with\na finger of their own they will not move them.\n5 And all their works they do for to be seen\nof men. For they make their phylacteries broad,\nand enlarge their fringes.\n6 And they love the first places at feasts, and\nthe first chairs in the synagogues,\n7 And salutations in the market place, and to\nbe called by men, Rabbi.\n8 But be not you called Rabbi. For one is your\nmaster; and all you are brethren.\n9 And call none your father upon earth; for\none is your father, who is in heaven.\n10 Neither be ye called masters; for one is you\nmaster, Christ.\n11 He that is the greatest among you shall be\nyour servant.\n12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be\nhumbled: and he that shall humble himself shall\nbe exalted.\n13 But woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you shut the kingdom of heaven\nagainst men, for you yourselves do not enter in;\nand those that are going in, you suffer not to\nenter.\n14 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: because you devour the houses of widows, praying long prayers. For this you shall\nreceive the greater judgment.\n15 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you go round about the sea and\nthe land to make one proselyte; and when he is\nmade, you make him the child of hell twofold\nmore than yourselves.\n16 Woe to you blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but\nhe that shall swear by the gold of the temple, is\na debtor.\n17 Ye foolish and blind; for whether is greater,\nthe gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?\n18 And whosoever shall swear by the altar, it\nis nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift\nthat is upon it, is a debtor.\n19 Ye blind: for whether is greater, the gift,\nor the altar that sanctifieth the gift?\n20 He therefore that sweareth by the altar,\nsweareth by it, and by all things that are upon\nit:\n21 And whosoever shall swear by temple,\nsweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth in it:\n22 And he that sweareth by heaven, sweareth\nby the throne of God, and by him that sitteth\nthereon.\n23 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you tithe mint, and anise, and\ncummin, and have left the weightier things of\nthe law; judgment, and mercy, and faith. These\nthings you ought to have done, and not to leave\nthose undone.\n24 Blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and\nswallow a camel.\n25 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you make clean the outside of\nthe cup and of the dish, but within you are full\nof rapine and uncleanness.\n26 Thou blind Pharisee, first make clean the\ninside of the cup and of the dish, that the outside\nmay become clean.\n27 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you are like to whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear to men beautiful,\nbut within are full of dead men\u2019s bones, and of\nall filthiness.\n28 So you also outwardly indeed appear to\nmen just; but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy\nand iniquity.\n29 Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; that build the sepulchres of the prophets,\nand adorn the monuments of the just,\n30 And say: If we had been in the days of our\nFathers, we would not have been partakers with\nthem in the blood of the prophets.\n31 Wherefore you are witnesses against yourselves, that you are the sons of them that killed\nthe prophets.\n32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.\n33 You serpents, generation of vipers, how will\nyou flee from the judgment of hell?\n34 Therefore behold I send to you prophets,\nand wise men, and scribes: and some of them\nyou will put to death and crucify, and some you\nwill scourge in your synagogues, and persecute\nfrom city to city:\n35 That upon you may come all the just blood\nthat hath been shed upon the earth, from the\nblood of Abel the just, even unto the blood of\nZacharias the son of Barachias, whom you killed\nbetween the temple and the altar.\n36 Amen I say to you, all these things shall\ncome upon this generation.\n37 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the\nprophets, and stonest them that are sent unto\nthee, how often would I have gathered together\nthy children, as the hen doth gather her chickens\nunder her wings, and thou wouldest not?\n38 Behold, you house shall be left to you, desolate.\n39 For I say to you, you shall not see me henceforth till you say: Blessed is he that cometh in\nthe name of the Lord.\n\nChapter 24\nAnd Jesus being come out of the temple, went\naway. And his disciples came to shew him the\nbuildings of the temple.\n2 And he answering, said to them: Do you see\nall these things? Amen I say to you there shall\nnot be left here a stone upon a stone that shall\nnot be destroyed.\n3 And when he was sitting on mount Olivet,\nthe disciples came to him privately, saying: Tell\nus when shall these things be? and what shall be\nthe sign of thy coming, and of the consummation\nof the world?\n4 And Jesus answering, said to them: Take\nheed that no man seduce you:\n5 For many will come in my name saying, I\nam Christ: and they will seduce many.\n6 And you shall hear of wars and rumours of\nwars. See that ye be not troubled. For these\nthings must come to pass, but the end is not\nyet.\n7 For nation shall rise against nation, and\nkingdom against kingdom; and there shall be\npestilences, and famines, and earthquakes in\nplaces:\n8 Now all these are the beginnings of sorrows.\n9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall put you to death: and you shall\nbe hated by all nations for my name\u2019s sake.\n10 And then shall many be scandalized: and\nshall betray one another: and shall hate one another.\n11 And many false prophets shall rise, and\nshall seduce many.\n12 And because iniquity hath abounded, the\ncharity of many shall grow cold.\n13 But he that shall persevere to the end, he\nshall be saved.\n14 And this gospel of the kingdom, shall be\npreached in the whole world, for a testimony\nto all nations, and then shall the consummation\ncome.\n15 When therefore you shall see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel\nthe prophet, standing in the holy place: he that\nreadeth let him understand.\n16 Then they that are in Judea, let them flee\nto the mountains:\n17 And he that is on the housetop, let him not\ncome down to take any thing out of his house:\n18 And he that is in the field, let him not go\nback to take his coat.\n19 And woe to them that are with child, and\nthat give suck in those days.\n20 But pray that your flight be not in the\nwinter, or on the sabbath.\n21 For there shall be then great tribulation,\nsuch as hath not been from the beginning of the\nworld until now, neither shall be.\n22 And unless those days had been shortened,\nno flesh should be saved: but for the sake of the\nelect those days shall be shortened.\n23 Then if any man shall say to you: Lo here\nis Christ, or there, do not believe him.\n24 For there shall arise false Christs and false\nprophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch as to deceive (if possible) even\nthe elect.\n25 Behold I have told it to you, beforehand.\n26 If therefore they shall say to you: Behold\nhe is in the desert, go ye not out: Behold he is\nin the closets, believe it not.\n27 For as lightning cometh out of the east,\nand appeareth even into the west: so shall the\ncoming of the Son of man be.\n28 Wheresoever the body shall be, there shall\nthe eagles also be gathered together.\n29 And immediately after the tribulation of\nthose days, the sun shall be darkened and the\nmoon shall not give her light, and the stars shall\nfall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall\nbe moved:\n30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son\nof man in heaven: and then shall all tribes of the\nearth mourn: and they shall see the Son of man\ncoming in the clouds of heaven with much power\nand majesty.\n31 And he shall send his angels with a trumpet, and a great voice: and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the farthest parts of the heavens to the utmost bounds\nof them.\n32 And from the fig tree learn a parable:\nWhen the branch thereof is now tender, and the\nleaves come forth, you know that summer is nigh.\n33 So you also, when you shall see all these\nthings, know ye that it is nigh, even at the doors.\n34 Amen I say to you, that this generation\nshall not pass, till all these things be done.\n35 Heaven and earth shall pass, but my words\nshall not pass.\n36 But of that day and hour no one knoweth,\nnot the angels of heaven, but the Father alone.\n37 And as in the days of Noe, so shall also the\ncoming of the Son of man be.\n38 For as in the days before the flood, they\nwere eating and drinking, marrying and giving in\nmarriage, even till that day in which Noe entered\ninto the ark,\n39 And they knew not till the flood came, and\ntook them all away; so also shall the coming of\nthe Son of man be.\n40 Then two shall be in the field: one shall be\ntaken, and one shall be left.\n41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill:\none shall be taken, and one shall be left.\n42 Watch ye therefore, because ye know not\nwhat hour your Lord will come.\n43 But know this ye, that if the goodman of\nthe house knew at what hour the thief would\ncome, he would certainly watch, and would not\nsuffer his house to be broken open.\n44 Wherefore be you also ready, because at\nwhat hour you know not the Son of man will\ncome.\n45 Who, thinkest thou, is a faithful and wise\nservant, whom his lord hath appointed over his\nfamily, to give them meat in season.\n46 Blessed is that servant, whom when his lord\nshall come he shall find so doing.\n47 Amen I say to you, he shall place him over\nall his goods.\n48 But if that evil servant shall say in his\nheart: My lord is long a coming:\n49 And shall begin to strike his fellow servants, and shall eat and drink with drunkards:\n50 The lord of that servant shall come in a\nday that he hopeth not, and at an hour that he\nknoweth not:\n51 And shall separate him, and appoint his\nportion with the hypocrites. There shall be\nweeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\nChapter 25\nThen shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten\nvirgins, who taking their lamps went out to meet\nthe bridegroom and the bride.\n2 And five of them were foolish, and five wise.\n3 But the five foolish, having taken their\nlamps, did not take oil with them:\n4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with\nthe lamps.\n5 And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept.\n6 And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet\nhim.\n7 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed\ntheir lamps.\n8 And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of\nyour oil, for our lamps are gone out.\n9 The wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps\nthere be not enough for us and for you, go ye\nrather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.\n10 Now whilst they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready, went in\nwith him to the marriage, and the door was shut.\n11 But at last come also the other virgins,\nsaying: Lord, Lord, open to us.\n12 But he answering said: Amen I say to you,\nI know you not.\n13 Watch ye therefore, because you know not\nthe day nor the hour.\n14 For even as a man going into a far country, called his servants, and delivered to them his\ngoods;\n15 And to one he gave five talents, and to\nanother two, and to another one, to every one\naccording to his proper ability: and immediately\nhe took his journey.\n16 And he that had received the five talents,\nwent his way, and traded with the same, and\ngained other five.\n17 And in like manner he that had received\nthe two, gained other two.\n18 But he that had received the one, going\nhis way digged into the earth, and hid his lord\u2019s\nmoney.\n19 But after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reckoned with them.\n20 And he that had received the five talents\ncoming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord,\nthou didst deliver to me five talents, behold I\nhave gained other five over and above.\n21 His lord said to him: Well done, good and\nfaithful servant, because thou hast been faithful\nover a few things, I will place thee over many\nthings: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\n22 And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two\ntalents to me: behold I have gained other two.\n23 His lord said to him: Well done, good and\nfaithful servant: because thou hast been faithful\nover a few things, I will place thee over many\nthings: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\n24 But he that had received the one talent,\ncame and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard\nman; thou reapest where thou hast not sown,\nand gatherest where thou hast not strewed.\n25 And being afraid I went and hid thy talent\nin the earth: behold here thou hast that which\nis thine.\n26 And his lord answering, said to him:\nWicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that\nI reap where I sow not, and gather where I have\nnot strewed:\n27 Thou oughtest therefore to have committed\nmy money to the bankers, and at my coming I\nshould have received my own with usury.\n28 Take ye away therefore the talent from him,\nand give it to him that hath ten talents.\n29 For to every one that hath shall be given,\nand he shall abound: but from him that hath\nnot, that also which he seemeth to have shall be\ntaken away.\n30 And the unprofitable servant cast ye out\ninto the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n31 And when the Son of man shall come in his\nmajesty, and all the angels with him, then shall\nhe sit upon the seat of his majesty.\n32 And all nations shall be gathered together\nbefore him, and he shall separate them one from\nanother, as the shepherd separateth the sheep\nfrom the goats:\n33 And he shall set the sheep on his right\nhand, but the goats on his left.\n34 Then shall the king say to them that shall\nbe on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my\nFather, possess you the kingdom prepared for\nyou from the foundation of the world.\n35 For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat;\nI was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a\nstranger, and you took me in:\n36 Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you\nvisited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.\n37 Then shall the just answer him, saying:\nLord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee;\nthirsty, and gave thee drink?\n38 And when did we see thee a stranger, and\ntook thee in? or naked, and covered thee?\n39 Or when did we see thee sick or in prison,\nand came to thee?\n40 And the king answering, shall say to them:\nAmen I say to you, as long as you did it to one\nof these my least brethren, you did it to me.\n41 Then he shall say to them also that shall\nbe on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed,\ninto everlasting fire which was prepared for the\ndevil and his angels.\n42 For I was hungry, and you gave me not to\neat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink.\n43 I was a stranger, and you took me not\nin: naked, and you covered me not: sick and\nin prison, and you did not visit me.\n44 Then they also shall answer him, saying:\nLord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or\na stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and\ndid not minister to thee?\n45 Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen\nI say to you, as long as you did it not to one of\nthese least, neither did you do it to me.\n46 And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting.\n\nChapter 26\nAnd it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all\nthese words, he said to his disciples:\n2 You know that after two days shall be the\npasch, and the son of man shall be delivered up\nto be crucified:\n3 Then were gathered together the chief\npriests and ancients of the people into the court\nof the high priest, who was called Caiphas:\n4 And they consulted together, that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus, and put him\nto death.\n5 But they said: Not on the festival day, lest\nperhaps there should be a tumult among the people.\n6 And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the\nhouse of Simon the leper,\n7 There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment, and poured it\non his head as he was at table.\n8 And the disciples seeing it, had indignation,\nsaying: To what purpose is this waste?\n9 For this might have been sold for much, and\ngiven to the poor.\n10 And Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why\ndo you trouble this woman? for she hath\nwrought a good work upon me.\n11 For the poor you have always with you:\nbut me you have not always.\n12 For she in pouring this ointment upon my\nbody, hath done it for my burial.\n13 Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel\nshall be preached in the whole world, that also\nwhich she hath done, shall be told for a memory\nof her.\n14 Then went one of the twelve, who was\ncalled Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,\n15 And said to them: What will you give me,\nand I will deliver him unto you? But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.\n16 And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him.\n17 And on the first day of the Azymes, the\ndisciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou\nthat we prepare for thee to eat the pasch?\n18 But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a\ncertain man, and say to him: the master saith,\nMy time is near at hand, with thee I make the\npasch with my disciples.\n19 And the disciples did as Jesus appointed\nto them, and they prepared the pasch.\n20 But when it was evening, he sat down with\nhis twelve disciples.\n21 And whilst they were eating, he said:\nAmen I say to you, that one of you is about to\nbetray me.\n22 And they being very much troubled, began\nevery one to say: Is it I, Lord?\n23 But he answering, said: He that dippeth\nhis hand with me in the dish, he shall betray\nme.\n24 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the\nSon of man shall be betrayed: it were better for\nhim, if that man had not been born.\n25 And Judas that betrayed him, answering,\nsaid: Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him: Thou hast\nsaid it.\n26 And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took\nbread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his\ndisciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my\nbody.\n27 And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and\ngave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this.\n28 For this is my blood of the new testament,\nwhich shall be shed for many unto remission of\nsins.\n29 And I say to you, I will not drink from\nhenceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that\nday when I shall drink it with you new in the\nkingdom of my Father.\n30 And a hymn being said, they went out unto\nmount Olivet.\n31 Then Jesus said to them: All you shall be\nscandalized in me this night. For it is written:\nI will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the\nflock shall be dispersed:\n32 But after I shall be risen again, I will go\nbefore you into Galilee.\n33 And Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will\nnever be scandalized.\n34 Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, that\nin this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny\nme thrice.\n35 Peter saith to him: Yea, though I should\ndie with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like\nmanner said all the disciples.\n36 Then Jesus came with them into a country\nplace which is called Gethsemani; and he said to\nhis disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and\npray.\n37 And taking with him Peter and the two\nsons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and\nto be sad.\n38 Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful\neven unto death: stay you here, and watch with\nme.\n39 And going a little further, he fell upon his\nface, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be\npossible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.\n40 And he cometh to his disciples, and findeth them asleep, and he saith to Peter: What?\nCould you not watch one hour with me?\n41 Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into\ntemptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the\nflesh weak.\n42 Again the second time, he went and prayed,\nsaying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass\naway, but I must drink it, thy will be done.\n43 And he cometh again and findeth them\nsleeping: for their eyes were heavy.\n44 And leaving them, he went again: and he\nprayed the third time, saying the selfsame word.\n45 Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith\nto them: Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold\nthe hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be\nbetrayed into the hands of sinners.\n46 Rise, let us go: behold he is at hand that\nwill betray me.\n47 As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the\ntwelve, came, and with him a great multitude\nwith swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests\nand the ancients of the people.\n48 And he that betrayed him, gave them a\nsign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is\nhe, hold him fast.\n49 And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said:\nHail, Rabbi. And he kissed him.\n50 And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art\nthou come? Then they came up, and laid hands\non Jesus, and held him.\n51 And behold one of them that were with\nJesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his\nsword: and striking the servant of the high\npriest, cut off his ear.\n52 Then Jesus saith to him: Put up again thy\nsword into its place: for all that take the sword\nshall perish with the sword.\n53 Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father,\nand he will give me presently more than twelve\nlegions of angels?\n54 How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,\nthat so it must be done?\n55 In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes: You are come out as it were to a robber\nwith swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat\ndaily with you, teaching in the temple, and you\nlaid not hands on me.\n56 Now all this was done, that the scriptures\nof the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all leaving him, fled.\n57 But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas\nthe high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled.\n58 And Peter followed him afar off, even to\nthe court of the high priest. And going in, he\nsat with the servants, that he might see the end.\n59 And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they\nmight put him to death:\n60 And they found not, whereas many false\nwitnesses had come in. And last of all there came\ntwo false witnesses:\n61 And they said: This man said, I am able to\ndestroy the temple of God, and after three days\nto rebuild it.\n62 And the high priest rising up, said to\nhim: Answerest thou nothing to the things which\nthese witness against thee?\n63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high\npriest said to him: I adjure thee by the living\nGod, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the\nSon of God.\n64 Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the\nSon of man sitting on the right hand of the power\nof God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\n65 Then the high priests rent his garments,\nsaying: He hath blasphemed; what further need\nhave we of witnesses? Behold, now you have\nheard the blasphemy:\n66 What think you? But they answering, said:\nHe is guilty of death.\n67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted\nhim: and others struck his face with the palms\nof their hands,\n68 Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who\nis he that struck thee?\n69 But Peter sat without in the court: and\nthere came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou\nalso wast with Jesus the Galilean.\n70 But he denied before them all, saying: I\nknow not what thou sayest.\n71 And as he went out of the gate, another\nmaid saw him, and she saith to them that were\nthere: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.\n72 And again he denied with an oath, I know\nnot the man.\n73 And after a little while they came that\nstood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art\none of them; for even thy speech doth discover\nthee.\n74 Then he began to curse and to swear that\nhe knew not the man. And immediately the cock\ncrew.\n75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus\nwhich he had said: Before the cock crow, thou\nwilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept\nbitterly.\n\nChapter 27\nAnd when morning was come, all the chief priests\nand ancients of the people took counsel against\nJesus, that they might put him to death.\n2 And they brought him bound, and delivered\nhim to Pontius Pilate the governor.\n3 Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that\nhe was condemned, repenting himself, brought\nback the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests\nand ancients,\n4 Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent\nblood. But they said: What is that to us? look\nthou to it.\n5 And casting down the pieces of silver in the\ntemple, he departed: and went and hanged himself with an halter.\n6 But the chief priests having taken the pieces\nof silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into\nthe corbona, because it is the price of blood.\n7 And after they had consulted together, they\nbought with them the potter\u2019s field, to be a burying place for strangers.\n8 For this cause the field was called Haceldama, that is, The field of blood, even to this\nday.\n9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken\nby Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took\nthe thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that\nwas prized, whom they prized of the children of\nIsrael.\n10 And they gave them unto the potter\u2019s field,\nas the Lord appointed to me.\n11 And Jesus stood before the governor, and\nthe governor asked him, saying: Art thou the\nking of the Jews? Jesus saith to him: Thou\nsayest it.\n12 And when he was accused by the chief\npriests and ancients, he answered nothing.\n13 Then Pilate saith to him: Dost not thou\nhear how great testimonies they allege against\nthee?\n14 And he answered him to never a word; so\nthat the governor wondered exceedingly.\n15 Now upon the solemn day the governor was\naccustomed to release to the people one prisoner,\nwhom they would.\n16 And he had then a notorious prisoner, that\nwas called Barabbas.\n17 They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said: Whom will you that I release to you,\nBarabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?\n18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.\n19 And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou\nnothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because\nof him.\n20 But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people, that they should ask Barabbas, and make Jesus away.\n21 And the governor answering, said to them:\nWhether will you of the two to be released unto\nyou? But they said, Barabbas.\n22 Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then\nwith Jesus that is called Christ? They say all:\nLet him be crucified.\n23 The governor said to them: Why, what\nevil hath he done? But they cried out the more,\nsaying: Let him be crucified.\n24 And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made; taking\nwater washed his hands before the people, say-\ning: I am innocent of the blood of this just man;\nlook you to it.\n25 And the whole people answering, said: His\nblood be upon us and our children.\n26 Then he released to them Barabbas, and\nhaving scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them\nto be crucified.\n27 Then the soldiers of the governor taking\nJesus into the hall, gathered together unto him\nthe whole band;\n28 And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak\nabout him.\n29 And platting a crown of thorns, they put\nit upon his head, and a reed in his right hand.\nAnd bowing the knee before him, they mocked\nhim, saying: Hail, king of the Jews.\n30 And spitting upon him, they took the reed,\nand struck his head.\n31 And after they had mocked him, they took\noff the cloak from him, and put on him his own\ngarments, and led him away to crucify him.\n32 And going out, they found a man of\nCyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take\nup his cross.\n33 And they came to the place that is called\nGolgotha, which is the place of Calvary.\n34 And they gave him wine to drink mingled\nwith gall. And when he had tasted, he would\nnot drink.\n35 And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be\nfulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them;\nand upon my vesture they cast lots.\n36 And they sat and watched him.\n37 And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE\nJEWS.\n38 Then were crucified with him two thieves:\none on the right hand, and one on the left.\n39 And they that passed by, blasphemed him,\nwagging their heads,\n40 And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the\ntemple of God, and in three days dost rebuild\nit: save thy own self: if thou be the Son of God,\ncome down from the cross.\n41 In like manner also the chief priests, with\nthe scribes and ancients, mocking, said:\n42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If\nhe be the king of Israel, let him now come down\nfrom the cross, and we will believe him.\n43 He trusted in God; let him now deliver him\nif he will have him; for he said: I am the Son of\nGod.\n44 And the selfsame thing the thieves also,\nthat were crucified with him, reproached him\nwith.\n45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.\n46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with\na loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani?\nthat is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\n47 And some that stood there and heard, said:\nThis man calleth Elias.\n48 And immediately one of them running took\na sponge, and filled it with vinegar; and put it\non a reed, and gave him to drink.\n49 And the others said: Let be, let us see\nwhether Elias will come to deliver him.\n50 And Jesus again crying with a loud voice,\nyielded up the ghost.\n51 And behold the veil of the temple was rent\nin two from the top even to the bottom, and the\nearth quaked, and the rocks were rent.\n52 And the graves were opened: and many\nbodies of the saints that had slept arose,\n53 And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city, and appeared\nto many.\n54 Now the centurion and they that were with\nhim watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake,\nand the things that were done, were sore afraid,\nsaying: Indeed this was the Son of God.\n55 And there were there many women afar off,\nwho had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering\nunto him:\n56 Among whom was Mary Magdalen, and\nMary the mother of James and Joseph, and the\nmother of the sons of Zebedee.\n57 And when it was evening, there came a\ncertain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph,\nwho also himself was a disciple of Jesus.\n58 He went to Pilate, and asked the body of\nJesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body\nshould be delivered.\n59 And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it\nup in a clean linen cloth.\n60 And laid it in his own new monument,\nwhich he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled\na great stone to the door of the monument, and\nwent his way.\n61 And there was there Mary Magdalen, and\nthe other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre.\n62 And the next day, which followed the day of\npreparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees\ncame together to Pilate,\n63 Saying: Sir, we have remembered, that\nthat seducer said, while he was yet alive: After\nthree days I will rise again.\n64 Command therefore the sepulchre to be\nguarded until the third day: lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the\npeople: He is risen from the dead; and the last\nerror shall be worse than the first.\n65 Pilate saith to them: You have a guard;\ngo, guard it as you know.\n66 And they departing, made the sepulchre\nsure, sealing the stone, and setting guards.\n\nChapter 28\nAnd in the end of the sabbath, when it began\nto dawn towards the first day of the week, came\nMary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see the\nsepulchre.\n2 And behold there was a great earthquake.\nFor an angel of the Lord descended from heaven,\nand coming, rolled back the stone, and sat upon\nit.\n3 And his countenance was as lightning, and\nhis raiment as snow.\n4 And for fear of him, the guards were struck\nwith terror, and became as dead men.\n5 And the angel answering, said to the women:\nFear not you; for I know that you seek Jesus who\nwas crucified.\n6 He is not here, for he is risen, as he said.\nCome, and see the place where the Lord was laid.\n7 And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that\nhe is risen: and behold he will go before you\ninto Galilee; there you shall see him. Lo, I have\nforetold it to you.\n8 And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, running to tell his\ndisciples.\n9 And behold Jesus met them, saying: All\nhail. But they came up and took hold of his\nfeet, and adored him.\n10 Then Jesus said to them: Fear not. Go,\ntell my brethren that they go into Galilee, there\nthey shall see me.\n11 Who when they were departed, behold\nsome of the guards came into the city, and told\nthe chief priests all things that had been done.\n12 And they being assembled together with\nthe ancients, taking counsel, gave a great sum of\nmoney to the soldiers,\n13 Saying: Say you, His disciples came by\nnight, and stole him away when we were asleep.\n14 And if the governor shall hear this, we will\npersuade him, and secure you.\n15 So they taking the money, did as they were\ntaught: and this word was spread abroad among\nthe Jews even unto this day.\n16 And the eleven disciples went into Galilee,\nunto the mountain where Jesus had appointed\nthem.\n17 And seeing them they adored: but some\ndoubted.\n18 And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying:\nAll power is given to me in heaven and in earth.\n19 Going therefore, teach ye all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of\nthe Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\n20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am\nwith you all days, even to the consummation of the world."},o=function(n){var a=n.target.alt;e(t[a])};return(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"examples",children:[(0,a.jsx)("h2",{children:"Example transcripts to copy in"}),(0,a.jsxs)("ul",{className:"examples__examples",children:[(0,a.jsxs)("li",{className:"examples__item",children:[(0,a.jsx)("img",{className:"examples__icon-copy",alt:"starwars",src:n(600),onClick:o}),(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"examples__description",children:"Star Wars movie transcript"})]}),(0,a.jsxs)("li",{className:"examples__item",children:[(0,a.jsx)("img",{className:"examples__icon-copy",alt:"americanConstitution",src:n(600),onClick:o}),(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"examples__description",children:"American Constitution 1787"})]}),(0,a.jsxs)("li",{className:"examples__item",children:[(0,a.jsx)("img",{className:"examples__icon-copy",alt:"bibleMatthewsGospel",src:n(600),onClick:o}),(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"examples__description",children:"The Bible : Matthew's Gospel"})]})]})]})};function Ae(){return(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"App",children:[(0,a.jsx)(o,{}),(0,a.jsx)(s,{}),(0,a.jsx)(Te,{}),(0,a.jsx)(pe,{}),(0,a.jsx)(ke,{}),(0,a.jsx)(Ee,{})]})}t.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render((0,a.jsx)(Ae,{}))}()}();
