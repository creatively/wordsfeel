`A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away... .It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evilGalactic Empire.During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plansto the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armoredspace station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia raceshome aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans thatcan save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a totaleclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tinysilver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursedby a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadlylaserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causingthe main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.1 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY 1An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their waythrough the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots areold and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. Hisface is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot ofhuman proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallicsurface of an Art Deco design.Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.THREEPIODid you hear that? They've shutdown the main reactor. We'll bedestroyed for sure. This ismadness!Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions inthe main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.THREEPIO (CONT’D)We're doomed!The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds thatonly another robot could understand.THREEPIO (CONT’D)There'll be no escape for thePrincess this time.Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts asloud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavyequipment are heard moving around the outside hull of theship.THREEPIO (CONT’D)What's that?2 EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE 2The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel BlockadeRunner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into theunderside dock of the giant Imperial starship.3 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER 3The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly atremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway anda score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers maketheir way into the smoke-filled corridor.In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze withlaserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patternscreating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duckbehind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebelsoldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holdingshattered arms and faces.An explosion hits near the robots.THREEPIOI should have known better than totrust the logic of a half-sizedthermocapsulary dehousingassister...Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle ragesaround the two hapless robots.4 EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY 4A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lonefigure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirationswho looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggyhair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple butlovable lad with a prize-winning smile.2.A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on alarge battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of thedesert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aidedby a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robotappears to be barely functioning and moves with jerkymotions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke'seye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinocularsfrom his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a fewmoments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented,crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport thattravels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). Hemotions for the tiny robot to follow him.LUKEHurry up! Come with me! What areyou waiting for?! Get in gear!The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, andsmoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws hisarms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumpsinto his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hummadly.5 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY 5The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes hisway into the blinding light of the main passageway. This isDarth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscuredby his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, whichstands out next to the fascist white armored suits of theImperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs awayfrom the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps throughthe Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and runin a frenzied panic.6 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER 6A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.Artoo makes beeping sounds.7 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER 7Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo isnowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebelsoldiers can be heard in the distance.THREEPIOArtoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention andhe spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smokefilled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen yearsold) stands in front of Artoo.3.Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in thesmoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computerface, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.THREEPIO (CONT’D)At last! Where have you been?Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.THREEPIO (CONT’D)They're heading in this direction.What are we going to do? We'll besent to the spice mine of Kessel orsmashed into who knows what!Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down thesubhallway. Threepio chases after him.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Wait a minute, where are you going?Artoo responds with electronic beeps.8 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR 8The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twistedbodies of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by theneck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.IMPERIAL OFFICERThe Death Star plans are not in themain computer.Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who strugglesin vain.VADERWhere are those transmissions youintercepted?Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.VADER (CONT’D)What have you done with thoseplans?REBEL OFFICERWe intercepted no transmissions.Aaah... This is a consular ship.Were on a diplomatic mission.VADERIf this is a consular ship... wereis the Ambassador?4.The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as theDark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating agruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns tohis troops.VADER (CONT’D)Commander, tear this ship apartuntil you've found those plans andbring me the Ambassador. I want heralive!The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.9 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY 9The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as thestormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess LeiaOrgana, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in hereyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing soundsof the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of thetroopers spots her.TROOPERThere she is! Set for stun!Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper withher laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by aparalyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.TROOPER (CONT’D)She'll be all right. Inform LordVader we have a prisoner.10 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY 10Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod.He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning lightbegins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way intothe cramped four-man pod.THREEPIOHey, you're not permitted in there.It's restricted. You'll bedeactivated for sure..Artoo beeps something to him.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Don't call me a mindlessphilosopher, you overweight glob ofgrease! Now come out beforesomebody sees you.5.Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regardingthe mission he is about to perform.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Secret mission? What plans? Whatare you talking about? I'm notgetting in there!Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beepsand twangs angrily.A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debristhrough the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lankyrobot jumps into the lifepod.THREEPIO (CONT’D)I'm going to regret this.11 INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER 11On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the twoterrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebelspacecraft.CHIEF PILOTThere goes another one.CAPTAINHold your fire. There are no lifeforms. It must have been shortcircuited.12 INT. LIFEPOD 12Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperialstarship. Stars circle as the pod rotates through thegalaxy.THREEPIOThat's funny, the damage doesn'tlook as bad from out here.Artoo beeps an assuring response.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Are you sure this things safe?13 EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY13Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached whitebuildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dustyempty street of the tiny settlement.6.An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speedingvehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past.WOMANI've told you kids to slow down!14 INT. POWER STATION - DAY 14Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, arugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who hasbeen asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races throughthe office, yelling wildly.FIXERDid I hear a young noise blastthrough here?CAMIEIt was just wormie on anotherrampage.Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deakand Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, areplaying a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashycity attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunicsof the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in thebackground.LUKEShape it up you guys!... Biggs?Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way togreat joy and emotion. They give each other a great bearhug.LUKE (CONT’D)I didn't know you were back! Whendid you get in?BIGGSJust now. I wanted to surprise you,hot shot. I thought you'd behere... certainly didn't expect youto be out working.(he laughs)LUKEThe Academy didn't change youmuch...but you're back so soon?Hey, what happened, didn't you getyour commission?Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.7.BIGGSOf course I got it. Signed aboardThe Rand Ecliptic last week. Firstmate Biggs Darklighter at yourservice...(he salutes)...I just came to say good-bye toall you unfortunate landlockedsimpletons.Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashingfriend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snapsout of it.LUKEI almost forgot. There's a battlegoing on! Right here in our system.Come and look!DEAKNot again! Forget it.15 EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION -15DAYThe group stumbles out into thestifling desert sun. Camie and TheFixer complain and are forced toshade their eyes. Luke has hisbinoculars out scanning theheavens.LUKEThere they are!Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain tosee something with the naked eye. Through the binocularsBiggs sees two small silver specks.BIGGSThat's no battle, hot shot...they're just sitting there!Probably a freighter-tankerrefueling.LUKEBut there was a lot of firingearlier...Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against thebuilding in the process. Luke grabs them.LUKE (CONT’D)Hey, easy with those...8.CAMIEDon't worry about it, Wormie.The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boyshrugs his shoulders in resignation.FIXERI keep telling you, the Rebellionis a long way from here. I doubt ifthe Empire would even fight to keepthis system. Believe me Luke, thisplanet is a big hunk of nothing...Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. Thegroup stumbles back into the power station, grumbling aboutLuke's ineptitude.16 INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY 16Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squadof armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she isbrutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with thebriskly marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway asDarth Vader emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lordstares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn'tmove.LEIALord Vader, I should have known.Only you could be so bold. TheImperial Senate will not sit forthis, when they hear you'veattacked a diplomatic...VADERDon't play games with me, YourHighness. You weren't on any mercymission this time. You passeddirectly through a restrictedsystem. Several transmissions werebeamed to this ship by Rebel spies.I want to know what happened to theplans they sent you.LEIAI don't know what you're talkingabout. I'm a member of the ImperialSenate on a diplomatic mission toAlderaan...VADERYou're a part of the RebelAlliance... and a traitor. Take heraway!9.Leia is marched away down the hallway and into thesmoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An ImperialCommander turns to Vader.COMMANDERHolding her is dangerous. If wordof this gets out, it could generatesympathy for the Rebellion in thesenate.VADERI have traced the Rebel spies toher. Now she is my only link tofind their secret base!COMMANDERShe'll die before she tells youanything.VADERLeave that to me. Send a distresssignal and then inform the senatethat all aboard were killed!Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.They stop and snap to attention.SECOND OFFICERLord Vader, the battle stationplans are not aboard this ship! Andno transmissions were made. Anescape pod was jettisoned duringthe fighting, but no life formswere aboard.Vader turns to the Commander.VADERShe must have hidden the plans inthe escape pod. Send a detachmentdown to retrieve them. See to itpersonally, Commander. There'll beno one to stop us this time.COMMANDERYes, sir.17 EXT. SPACE 17The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of theplanet Tatooine.10.18 EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT 18Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesasmeet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droidskick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod andclumsily work their way across the desert wasteland. Thelifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand.THREEPIOHow did I get into this mess? Ireally don't know how. We seem tobe made to suffer. It's our lot inlife.Artoo answers with beeping sounds.THREEPIO (CONT’D)I've got to rest before I fallapart. My joints are almost frozen.Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.THREEPIO (CONT’D)What a desolate place this is.Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and startsoff in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepiostops and yells at him.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Where are you going?A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the smallrobot.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Well, I'm not going that way. It'smuch too rocky. This way is mucheasier.Artoo counters with a long whistle.THREEPIO (CONT’D)What makes you think there aresettlements over there?Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Don't get technical with me.Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.11.THREEPIO (CONT’D)What mission? What are you talkingabout? I've had just about enoughof you! Go that way! You'll bemalfunctioning within a day, younearsighted scrap pile!Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in thedirection of the vast dune sea.THREEPIO (CONT’D)And don't let me catch youfollowing me begging for help,because you won't get it.Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudgesoff in the direction of the towering mesas.THREEPIO (CONT’D)No more adventures. I'm not goingthat way.Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward thedistant mountains.19 EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA 19Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of adune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on forendless miles. He looks back in the direction of the nowdistant rock mesas.THREEPIOThat malfunctioning little twerp.This is all his fault! He trickedme into going this way, but he'lldo no better.In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sandfrom his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint ofreflected light in the distance reveals an object movingtowards him.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Wait, what's that? A transport! I'msaved!The bronze android waves frantically and yells at theapproaching transport.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Over here! Help! Please, help!12.20 EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY20Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixerand the others can be heard working inside.LUKE(Very animated)...so I cut off my power, shut downthe afterburners and came in low onDeak's trail. I was so close Ithought I was going to fry myinstruments. As it was I busted upthe Skyhopper pretty bad. UncleOwen was pretty upset. He groundedme for the rest of the season. Youshould have been there... it wasfantastic.BIGGSYou ought to take it easy Luke. Youmay be the hottest bushpilot thisside of Mos Eisley, but thoselittle Skyhoppers are dangerous.Keep it up, and one day, whammo,you're going to be nothing morethan a dark spot on the down sideof a canyon wall.LUKELook who's talking. Now that you'vebeen around those giant starshipsyou're beginning to sound like myuncle. You've gotten soft in thecity...BIGGSI've missed you kid.LUKEWell, things haven't been the samesince you left, Biggs. It's beenso... quiet.Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.BIGGSLuke, I didn't come back just tosay good-bye... I shouldn't tellyou this, but you're the only one Ican trust... and if I don't comeback, I want somebody to know.Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.13.LUKEWhat are you talking about?BIGGSI made some friends at the Academy.(he whispers)...when our frigate goes to one ofthe central systems, we're going tojump ship and join the Alliance...Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.LUKEJoin the Rebellion?! Are youkidding! How?BIGGSQuiet down will ya! You got a mouthbigger than a meteor crater!LUKEI'm sorry. I'm quiet.(he whispers)Listen how quiet I am. You canbarely hear me...Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.BIGGSMy friend has a friend on Bestinewho might help us make contact.LUKEYou're crazy! You could wanderaround forever trying to find them.BIGGSI know it's a long shot, but if Idon't find them I'll do what I canon my own... It's what we alwaystalked about. Luke, I'm not goingto wait for the Empire to draft meinto service. The Rebellion isspreading and I want to be on theright side -- the side I believein.LUKEAnd I'm stuck here...BIGGSI thought you were going to theAcademy next term. You'll get yourchance to get off this rock.14.LUKENot likely! I had to cancel myapplication. There has been a lotof unrest among the Sandpeoplesince you left... they've evenraided the outskirts of Anchorhead.BIGGSYour uncle could hold off a wholecolony of Sandpeople with oneblaster.LUKEI know, but he's got enoughvaporators going to make the placepay off. He needs me for just onemore season. I can't leave him now.BIGGSI feel for you, Luke, you're goingto have to learn what seems to beimportant or what really isimportant. What good is all youruncle's work if it's taken over bythe Empire?... You know they'restarting to nationalize commerce inthe central systems... it won't belong before your uncle is merely atenant, slaving for the greaterglory of the Empire.LUKEIt couldn't happen here. You saidit yourself. The Empire won'tbother with this rock.BIGGSThings always change.LUKEI wish I was going... Are you goingto be around long?BIGGSNo, I'm leaving in the morning...LUKEThen I guess I won't see you.BIGGSMaybe someday... I'll keep alookout.15.LUKEWell, I'll be at the Academy nextseason... after that who knows. Iwon't be drafted into the ImperialStarfleet that's for sure... Takecare of yourself, you'll always bethe best friend I've got.BIGGSSo long, Luke.Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards thepower station.21 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET 21The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strangeforeboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthlycreatures fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through thecreepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clickingnoise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic soundand stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continueson his way.In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon walland a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A littlefurther up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals apair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from thenarrow path.The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail untilsuddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots outof the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He managesone short electronic squeak before he topples over onto hisback. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, thenoff again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no tallerthan Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as theycautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks andtheir faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can beseen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heavethe heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off downthe trail.22 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET 22The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tanklike vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld asmall disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under alarge tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robotis sucked into the giant machine.The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small laddersand enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.16.23 INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA 23It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artooswitches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumblesaround the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rustymetal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted andmaimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronicwhimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door atthe end of the chamber.24 INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA 24Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In themiddle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of variousshapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronicconversation, while others simply mill about. A voice ofrecognition calls out from the gloom.THREEPIOArtoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.25 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET 25The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificenttwin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountainridge.26 EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY 26Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the halfburied lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine.A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.FIRST TROOPERSomeone was in the pod. The tracksgo off in this direction.A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sandand gives it to the first trooper.SECOND TROOPERLook, sir -- droids.27 EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES 27The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.28 INT. SANDCRAWLER 28Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the crampedprison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.17.THREEPIOWake up! Wake up!Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computerlights pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of thelong chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber withblinding white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their waythrough the odd assortment of robots.THREEPIO (CONT’D)We're doomed.A Jawa starts moving toward them.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Do you think they'll melt us down?Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.THREEPIO (CONT’D)Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will thisnever end?29 EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON 29The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up theirbattered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front ofthe enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a smallhomestead consisting of three large holes in the groundsurrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one smalladobe block house.The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots,straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dentedmetallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smellhorribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas whentheir mouths and nostrils should be.Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars,a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes aresunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefullyinspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slumpshouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile littleJawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated salespitch in a queer, unintelligible language.A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form thehomestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Berustanding in the main courtyard.18.BERULuke, tell Owen that if he gets atranslator to be sure it speaksBocce.LUKEIt looks like we don't have much ofa choice but I'll remind him.Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipmentfor sale with the Jawa leader.OWENI have no need for a protocoldroid.THREEPIO(quickly)Sir -- not in an environment suchas this -- that's why I've alsobeen programmed for over thirtysecondary functions that...OWENWhat I really need is a droid thatunderstands the binary language ofmoisture vaporators.THREEPIOVaporators! Sir -- My first job wasprogramming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators.You could say...OWENDo you speak Bocce?THREEPIOOf course I can, sir. It's like asecond language for me... I'm asfluent in Bocce...OWENAll right shut up!(turning to Jawa)I'll take this one.THREEPIOShutting up, sir.OWENLuke, take these two over to thegarage, will you?(MORE)19.I want you to have both of themcleaned up before dinner.LUKEBut I was going into Toshi Stationto pick up some power converters...OWENYou can waste time with yourfriends when your chores are done.Now come on, get to it!LUKEAll right, come on! And the redone, come on. Well, come on, Red,let's go.As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots backinto the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beepand starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrainedby a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the tworobots start off for the garage when a plate pops off thehead of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparkswildly.LUKE (CONT’D)Uncle Owen...OWENYeah?LUKEThis R2 unit has a bad motivator.Look!OWEN(to the head Jawa)Hey, what're you trying to push onus?The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo hassneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying toattract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepiotaps Luke on the shoulder.THREEPIO(pointing to Artoo)Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit isin prime condition. A real bargain.LUKEUncle Owen...OWEN (CONT'D)20.OWENYeah?LUKEWhat about that one?OWEN(to Jawa)What about that blue one? We'lltake that one.With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades thedamaged astro-droid for Artoo.LUKEYeah, take it away.THREEPIOUh, I'm quite sure you'll be verypleased with that one, sir. Hereally is in first-class condition.I've worked with him before. Herehe comes.Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robotstrudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.LUKEOkay, let's go.THREEPIO(to Artoo)Now, don't you forget this! Why Ishould stick my neck out for you isquite beyond my capacity!30 INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON 30The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peacefulatmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowershimself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near thebattered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large batterywith a cord to his face.THREEPIOThank the maker! This oil bath isgoing to feel so good. I've gotsuch a bad case of dustcontamination, I can barely move!21.Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost inthought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a smalltwo-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off thegarage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of himand he slams a wrench across the workbench.LUKEIt just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs isright. I'm never gonna get out ofhere!THREEPIOIs there anything I might do tohelp?Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his angerdrains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.LUKEWell, not unless you can altertime, speed up the harvest, orteleport me off this rock!THREEPIOI don't think so, sir. I'm only adroid and not very knowledgeableabout such things. Not on thisplanet, anyways. As a matter offact, I'm not even sure whichplanet I'm on.LUKEWell, if there's a bright center tothe universe, you're on the planetthat it's farthest from.THREEPIOI see, sir.LUKEUh, you can call me Luke.THREEPIOI see, sir Luke.LUKE(laughing)Just Luke.THREEPIOAnd I am See-Threepio, human-cyborgrelations, and this is mycounterpart, Artoo-Detoo.22.LUKEHello.Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins toscrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chromepick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wipingoil from his bronze body.LUKE (CONT’D)You got a lot of carbon scoringhere. It looks like you boys haveseen a lot of action.THREEPIOWith all we've been through,sometimes I'm amazed we're in asgood condition as we are, what withthe Rebellion and all.LUKEYou know of the Rebellion againstthe Empire?THREEPIOThat's how we came to be in yourservice, if you take my meaning,sir.LUKEHave you been in many battles?THREEPIOSeveral, I think. Actually, there'snot much to tell. I'm not much morethan an interpreter, and not verygood at telling stories. Well, notat making them interesting,anyways.Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo'sneck joint. He uses a larger pick.LUKEWell, my little friend, you've gotsomething jammed in here real good.Were you on a cruiser or...The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumblinghead over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch threedimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator,being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image isa rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimlylit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.23.LEIAHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're myonly hope.LUKEWhat's this?Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer forThreepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentencefragment over and over.THREEPIOWhat is what?!? He asked you aquestion...(pointing to Leia)What is that?Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just noticethe hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answerfor Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat thesentence fragment over and over.LEIAHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're myonly hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.You're my only hope.THREEPIOOh, he says it's nothing, sir.Merely a malfunction. Old data. Payit no mind.Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.LUKEWho is she? She's beautiful.THREEPIOI'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.LEIAHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...THREEPIOI think she was a passenger on ourlast voyage. A person of someimportance, sir -- I believe. Ourcaptain was attached to...LUKEIs there more to this recording?Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several franticsqueaks and a whistle.24.THREEPIOBehave yourself, Artoo. You'regoing to get us in trouble. It'sall right, you can trust him. He'sour new master.Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.THREEPIO (CONT’D)He says he's the property of ObiWan Kenobi, a resident of theseparts. And it's a private messagefor him. Quite frankly, sir I don'tknow what he's talking about. Ourlast master was Captain Antilles,but with what we've been through,this little R2 unit has become abit eccentric.LUKEObi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if hemeans old Ben Kenobi?THREEPIOI beg your pardon, sir, but do youknow what he's talking about?LUKEWell, I don't know anyone named ObiWan, but old Ben lives out beyondthe dune sea. He's kind of astrange old hermit.Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a fewmoments.LUKE (CONT’D)I wonder who she is. It sounds likeshe's in trouble. I'd better playback the whole thing.Artoo beeps something to Threepio.THREEPIOHe says the restraining bolt hasshort circuited his recordingsystem. He suggests that if youremove the bolt, he might be ableto play back the entire recording.Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess andhasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.25.LUKEH'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you'retoo small to run away on me if Itake this off! Okay.Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt offArtoo's side.LUKE (CONT’D)There you go.The princess immediately disappears...LUKE (CONT’D)Well, wait a minute. Where'd shego? Bring her back! Play back theentire message.Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up inembarrassment.THREEPIOWhat message? The one you'recarrying inside your rusty innards!A women's voice calls out from another room.AUNT BERULuke? Luke! Come to dinner!Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioningrobot.LUKEAll right, I'll be right there,Aunt Beru.THREEPIOI'm sorry, sir, but he appears tohave picked up a slight flutter.Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench andhurries out of the room.LUKEWell, see what you can do with him.I'll be right back.THREEPIO(to Artoo)Just you reconsider playing thatmessage for him.Artoo beeps in response.26.THREEPIO (CONT’D)No, I don't think he likes you atall.Artoo beeps.THREEPIO (CONT’D)No, I don't like you either.31 INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA 31Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcherwith blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the wellused kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowlsof food and starts for the dining area.Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered withsteaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of redgrain.LUKEYou know, I think that R2 unit webought might have been stolen.OWENWhat makes you think that?LUKEWell, I stumbled across a recordingwhile I was cleaning him. He sayshe belongs to someone called ObiWan Kenobi.Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, butmanages to control himself.LUKE (CONT’D)I thought he might have meant oldBen. Do you know what he's talkingabout? Well, I wonder if he'srelated to Ben.Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.OWENThat old man's just a crazy oldwizard. Tomorrow I want you to takethat R2 unit into Anchorhead andhave its memory flushed. That'll bethe end of it. It belongs to usnow.27.LUKEBut what if this Obi-Wan comeslooking for him?OWENHe won't, I don't think he existsany more. He died about the sametime as your father.LUKEHe knew my father?OWENI told you to forget it. Your onlyconcern is to prepare the newdroids for tomorrow. In the morningI want them on the south ridgeworking out those condensers.LUKEYes, sir. I think those new droidsare going to work out fine. Infact, I, uh, was also thinkingabout our agreement about mystaying on another season. And ifthese new droids do work out, Iwant to transmit my application tothe Academy this year.Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppressit.OWENYou mean the next semester beforeharvest?LUKESure, there're more than enoughdroids.OWENHarvest is when I need you themost. Only one more season. Thisyear we'll make enough on theharvest so I'll be able to hiresome more hands. And then you cango to the Academy next year.Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at hisuncle.OWEN (CONT’D)You must understand I need youhere, Luke.28.LUKEBut it's a whole 'nother year.OWENLook, it's only one more season.Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.LUKEYeah, that's what you said lastyear when Biggs and Tank left.AUNT BERUWhere are you going?LUKEIt looks like I'm going nowhere. Ihave to finish cleaning thosedroids.Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owenmechanically finishes his dinner.AUNT BERUOwen, he can't stay here forever.Most of his friends have gone. Itmeans so much to him.OWENI'll make it up to him next year. Ipromise.AUNT BERULuke's just not a farmer, Owen. Hehas too much of his father in him.OWENThat's what I'm afraid of.32 EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD 32The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind adistant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a fewmoments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to thehomestead.33 INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE 33Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere insight. He takes a small control box from his utility beltsimilar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates thebox, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out ashort yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.29.LUKEWhat are you doing hiding there?Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere insight.THREEPIOIt wasn't my fault, sir. Pleasedon't deactivate me. I told him notto go, but he's faulty,malfunctioning; kept babbling onabout his mission.LUKEOh, no!Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.34 EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD 34Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homesteadand searches the darkening horizon for the small tripedastro- robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and onthe salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with hiselectrobinoculars.THREEPIOThat R2 unit has always been aproblem. These astro-droids aregetting quite out of hand. Even Ican't understand their logic attimes.LUKEHow could I be so stupid? He'snowhere in sight. Blast it!THREEPIOPardon me, sir, but couldn't we goafter him?LUKEIt's too dangerous with all theSandpeople around. We'll have towait until morning.Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.OWENLuke, I'm shutting the power downfor the night.30.LUKEAll right, I'll be there in a fewminutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.He takes one final look across the dim horizon.LUKE (CONT’D)You know that little droid is goingto cause me a lot of trouble.THREEPIOOh, he excels at that, sir.35 INT.

Did he take those two newdroids with him?AUNT BERUI think so.OWENWell, he'd better have those unitsin the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!37 EXT.

LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING -38DAYLuke leans over the back of thespeeder and adjusts something inthe motor compartment.LUKE(yelling)How's that.Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into thewind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.LUKE (CONT’D)Old Ben Kenobi lives out in thisdirection somewhere, but I don'tsee how that R2 unit could havecome this far. We must have missedhim. Uncle Owen isn't going to takethis very well.THREEPIOSir, would it help if you told himit was my fault.LUKE(brightening)Sure. He needs you. He'd probablyonly deactivate you for a day orso...THREEPIODeactivate! Well, on the other handif you hadn't removed hisrestraining bolt...LUKEWait, there's something dead aheadon the scanner. It looks like ourdroid... hit the accelerator.39 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY 39From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seengliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foregroundtwo weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desertcloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of themarginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifleand points it at the speeder but the second creature grabsthe gun before it can be fired.32.The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimescalled, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get intoan animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to getin the final word and the nomads scurry over the rockyterrain.40 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON 40The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tiedto a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as largeas elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns,and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raidersmount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backsand ride off down the rugged bluff.41 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR 41The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon.Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder,stands before little Artoo.LUKEHey, whoa, just where do you thinkyou're going?The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio posesmenacingly behind the little runaway.THREEPIOMaster Luke here is your rightfulowner. We'll have no more of thisObi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... anddon't talk to me about yourmission, either. You're fortunatehe doesn't blast you into a millionpieces right here.LUKEWell, come on. It's getting late. Ionly hope we can get back beforeUncle Owen really blows up.THREEPIOIf you don't mind my saying so,sir, I think you should deactivatethe little fugitive until you'vegotten him back to your workshop.LUKENo, he's not going to try anything.Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass offrantic whistles and screams.33.LUKE (CONT’D)What's wrong with him now?THREEPIOOh my... sir, he says there areseveral creatures approaching fromthe southeast.Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.LUKESandpeople! Or worst! Come on,let's have a look. Come on.42 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY 42Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge andscans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots thetwo riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind theyoung adventurer.LUKEThere are two Banthas down therebut I don't see any... wait asecond, they're Sandpeople allright. I can see one of them now.Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through hiselectrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front ofhis field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, alarge, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio isstartled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. Hecan be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs andrattles down the side of the mountain.The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointedgaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror inthe heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to blockthe blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces.The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forcedto the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider standsover him with his weapon raised and lets out a horribleshrieking laugh.43 EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY 43Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove inthe rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying theinert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before thespeeder. The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing partsand supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Theneverything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moanis heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends theSandpeople fleeing in terror.34.Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slightswishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows evencloser, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears andleans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked andweathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetratingeyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyesas he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes aslight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.BENHello there! Come here my littlefriend. Don't be afraid.Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap andbegins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand onLuke's forehead and he begins to come around.BEN (CONT’D)Don't worry, he'll be all right.LUKEWhat happened?BENRest easy, son, you've had a busyday. You're fortunate you're stillin one piece.LUKEBen? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad tosee you!BENThe Jundland wastes are not to betraveled lightly. Tell me youngLuke, what brings you out this far?LUKEOh, this little droid! I think he'ssearching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in adroid before... there seems to beno stopping him. He claims to bethe property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.Is he a relative of yours? Do youknow who he's talking about?Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.BENObi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Nowthats a name I haven't heard in along time... a long time.35.LUKEI think my uncle knew him. He saidhe was dead.BENOh, he's not dead, not... not yet.LUKEYou know him!BENWell of course, of course I knowhim. He's me! I haven't gone by thename Obi-Wan since oh, before youwere born.LUKEThen the droid does belong to you.BENDon't seem to remember ever owninga droid. Very interesting...He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.BEN (CONT’D)I think we better get indoors. TheSandpeople are easily startled butthey will soon be back and ingreater numbers.Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a patheticbeep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.LUKEThreepio!44 EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY 44Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit andbegins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps.Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepiolying half buried in the sand. One of his arms has brokenoff.Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and thenflips a hidden switch on his back several times untilfinally the mechanical man's systems turn on.THREEPIOWhere am I? I must have taken a badstep...36.LUKECan you stand? We've got to get outof here before the Sandpeoplereturn.THREEPIOI don't think I can make it. You goon, Master Luke. There's no sensein you risking yourself on myaccount. I'm done for.Artoo makes a beeping sound.LUKENo, you're not. What kind of talkis that?Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. LittleArtoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances aroundsuspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs theair.BENQuickly, son... they're on themove.45 INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING 45The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk butstill manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort andsecurity. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, asold Ben sits thinking.LUKENo, my father didn't fight in thewars. He was a navigator on a spicefreighter.BENThat's what your uncle told you. Hedidn't hold with your father'sideals. Thought he should havestayed here and not gotteninvolved.LUKEYou fought in the Clone Wars?BENYes, I was once a Jedi Knight thesame as your father.LUKEI wish I'd known him.37.BENHe was the best star-pilot in thegalaxy, and a cunning warrior. Iunderstand you've become quite agood pilot yourself. And he was agood friend. Which reminds me...Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. AsLuke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit therestraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on thetable. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handlewith several electronic gadgets attached to it.BEN (CONT’D)I have something here for you. Yourfather wanted you to have this whenyou were old enough, but your unclewouldn't allow it. He feared youmight follow old Obi-Wan on somedamned-fool idealistic crusade likeyour father did.THREEPIOSir, if you'll not be needing me,I'll close down for awhile.LUKESure, go ahead.Ben hands Luke the saber.LUKE (CONT’D)What is it?BENYour fathers lightsaber. This isthe weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not asclumsy or as random as a blaster.Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots outabout four feet and flickers there. The light plays acrossthe ceiling.BEN (CONT’D)An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time. For over a thousandgenerations the Jedi Knights werethe guardians of peace and justicein the Old Republic. Before thedark times, before the Empire.Luke hasn't really been listening.38.LUKEHow did my father die?BENA young Jedi named Darth Vader, whowas a pupil of mine until he turnedto evil, helped the Empire huntdown and destroy the Jedi Knights.He betrayed and murdered yourfather. Now the Jedi are all butextinct. Vader was seduced by thedark side of the Force.LUKEThe Force?BENWell, the Force is what gives aJedi his power. It's an energyfield created by all living things.It surrounds us and penetrates us.It binds the galaxy together.Artoo makes beeping sounds.BEN (CONT’D)Now, let's see if we can't figureout what you are, my little friend.And where you come from.LUKEI saw part of the message he was...Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautifulyoung Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.BENI seem to have found it.Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickersbefore his eyes.LEIAGeneral Kenobi, years ago youserved my father in the Clone Wars.Now he begs you to help him in hisstruggle against the Empire. Iregret that I am unable to presentmy father's request to you inperson, but my ship has fallenunder attack and I'm afraid mymission to bring you to Alderaanhas failed.(MORE)39.I have placed information vital tothe survival of the Rebellion intothe memory systems of this R2 unit.My father will know how to retrieveit. You must see this droid safelydelivered to him on Alderaan. Thisis our most desperate hour. Helpme, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my onlyhope.There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffson a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in hiseyes.BENYou must learn the ways of theForce if you're to come with me toAlderaan.LUKE(laughing)Alderaan? I'm not going toAlderaan. I've got to go home. It'slate, I'm in for it as it is.BENI need your help, Luke. She needsyour help. I'm getting too old forthis sort of thing.LUKEI can't get involved! I've got workto do! It's not that I like theEmpire. I hate it! But there'snothing I can do about it rightnow. It's such a long way fromhere.BENThat's your uncle talking.LUKE(sighing)Oh, God, my uncle. How am I evergoing to explain this?BENLearn about the Force, Luke.LUKELook, I can take you as far asAnchorhead.LEIA (CONT'D)(MORE)40.You can get a transport there toMos Eisley or wherever you'regoing.BENYou must do what you feel is right,of course.46 EXT.

Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general,is speaking.TAGGEUntil this battle station is fullyoperational we are vulnerable. TheRebel Alliance is too wellequipped. They're more dangerousthan you realize.The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.MOTTIDangerous to your starfleet,Commander, not to this battlestation!TAGGEThe Rebellion will continue to gaina support in the Imperial Senate aslong as....Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cutshort and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperialoutland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerfulally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals standand bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takeshis place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord standsbehind him.TARKINThe Imperial Senate will no longerbe of any concern to us. I've justreceived word that the Emperor hasdissolved the council permanently.The last remnants of the OldRepublic have been swept away.LUKE (CONT'D)41.TAGGEThat's impossible! How will theEmperor maintain control withoutthe bureaucracy?TARKINThe regional governors now havedirect control over territories.Fear will keep the local systems inline. Fear of this battle station.TAGGEAnd what of the Rebellion? If theRebels have obtained a completetechnical readout of this station,it is possible, however unlikely,that they might find a weakness andexploit it.VADERThe plans you refer to will soon beback in our hands.MOTTIAny attack made by the Rebelsagainst this station would be auseless gesture, no matter whattechnical data they've obtained.This station is now the ultimatepower in the universe. I suggest weuse it!VADERDon't be too proud of thistechnological terror you'veconstructed. The ability to destroya planet is insignificant next tothe power of the Force.MOTTIDon't try to frighten us with yoursorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Yoursad devotion to that ancientreligion has not helped you conjureup the stolen data tapes, or givenyou clairvoyance enough to find theRebel's hidden fort...Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader'sspell.VADERI find your lack of faithdisturbing.42.TARKINEnough of this! Vader, release him!VADERAs you wish.TARKINThis bickering is pointless. LordVader will provide us with thelocation of the Rebel fortress bythe time this station isoperational. We will then crush theRebellion with one swift stroke.48 EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND 48The speeder stops before what remains of the huge JawasSandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubbleand scattered bodies.LUKEIt looks like Sandpeople did this,all right. Look, here are Gaffisticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hittinganything this big before.Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.BENThey didn't. But we are meant tothink they did. These tracks areside by side. Sandpeople alwaysride single file to hide therenumbers.LUKEThese are the same Jawas that soldus Artoo and Threepio.BENAnd these blast points, tooaccurate for Sandpeople. OnlyImperial stormtroopers are soprecise.LUKEWhy would Imperial troops want toslaughter Jawas?Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio areinspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.43.LUKE (CONT’D)If they traced the robots here,they may have learned who they soldthem to. And that would lead themhome!Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races forthe speeder and jumps it.BENWait, Luke!

The muffled screams of the Rebel princess arebarely heard.53 EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND 53There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front ofthe Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning thedead. Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over tohim.BENThere's nothing you could havedone, Luke, had you been there.You'd have been killed, too, andthe droids would be in the hands ofthe Empire.LUKEI want to come with you toAlderaan. There's nothing here forme now. I want to learn the ways ofthe Force and become a Jedi like myfather.54 EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND 54The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in itzooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluffoverlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazardarray of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. Aharsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjustshis goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff whereBen is standing.BENMos Eisley Spaceport. You willnever find a more wretched hive ofscum and villainy. We must becautious.Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determinedsmile.55 EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET 55The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combathardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. ATrooper questions Luke.TROOPERHow long have you had these droids?45.LUKEAbout three or four seasons.BENThey're for sale if you want them.TROOPERLet me see your identification.Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID whileBen speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.BENYou don't need to see hisidentification.TROOPERWe don't need to see hisidentification.BENThese are not the droids yourlooking for.TROOPERThese are not the droids we'relooking for.BENHe can go about his business.TROOPERYou can go about your business.BEN(to Luke)Move along.TROOPERMove along.

Various strangeforms of transport, including several unusual beasts ofburden, are parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up andbegins to fondle the speeder.THREEPIOI can't abide these Jawas.Disgusting creatures.46.As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawaaway.LUKEGo on, go on. I can't understandhow we got by those troopers. Ithought we were dead.BENThe Force can have a stronginfluence on the weak-minded.

TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA 57The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants followBen Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldyden is filled with a startling array of weird and exoticalien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. Atfirst the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed,slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddleover drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near agroup of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-lookingBartender stops Luke and the robots.BARTENDERWe don't serve their kind here!Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so manyoutlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender'sdrift.LUKEWhat?47.BARTENDERYour droids. They'll have to waitoutside. We don't want them here.Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of theGalactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesomecreatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendlyglare.Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.LUKEListen, why don't you wait out bythe speeder. We don't want anytrouble.THREEPIOI heartily agree with you sir.Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of thecreatures at the bar go back to their drinks.Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savagelooking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey withfierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a furcovered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and asight to behold.Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several timesduring his conversation and the huge creature suddenly letsout a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bitdisconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversationbetween Ben and the giant Wookiee.Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sipshis drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic earor whatever.A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.CREATURENegola dewaghi wooldugger?!?The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignorethe creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubbyHuman and an even smaller rodent-like beast join thebelligerent monstrosity.HUMANHe doesn't like you.48.LUKEI'm sorry.HUMANI don't like you either.The big creature is getting agitated and yells out someunintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, youngadventurer.HUMAN (CONT’D)Don't insult us. You just watchyourself. We're wanted men. I havethe death sentence in twelvesystems.LUKEI'll be careful than.HUMANYou'll be dead.The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the barmoves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. Histhree adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves inbehind Luke.BENThis little one isn't worth theeffort. Come let me buy yousomething...A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the youngwould-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing throughtables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-lookingliquid. With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws awicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it atold Ben. The bartender panics.BARTENDERNo blasters! No blaster!With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to lifeand in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cutin two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turnsoff his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt.Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities,attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matterof seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben isgiven a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbinghis bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Benpoints the the Wookiee.49.BENThis is Chewbacca. He's first-mateon a ship that might suit ourneeds.58 EXT.

As a matter of fact, Iwas just going to see your boss.Tell Jabba that I've got his money.Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding thegun on him.GREEDOIt's too late. You should have paidhim when you had the chance.Jabba's put a price on your head,so large that every bounty hunterin the galaxy will be looking foryou. I'm lucky I found you first.HANYeah, but this time I got themoney.52.GREEDOIf you give it to me, I mightforget I found you.HANI don't have it with me. TellJabba...GREEDOJabba's through with you.

I've been lookingforward to killing you for a longtime.HANYes, I'll bet you have.Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash oflight.

The ball shoots straight up in the air, thendrops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindlymissing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hitsLuke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painfulyell and attempts to hit the seeker.BEN (CONT’D)Stretch out with your feelings.Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makesa dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect thebolt.

I knew that you weregoing to say that!BENWho's the more foolish... the foolor the fool who follows him?73.Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.105 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY 105The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past thetwo stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.TROOPERThe ship's all yours. If thescanners pick up anything, reportit immediately. All right, let'sgo.The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing soundis followed by a voice calling to the guard below.HAN'S VOICEHey down there, could you give us ahand with this?The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round ofgunfire is heard.106 INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE 106In a very small command office near the entrance to thepirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window andnotices the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.GANTRY OFFICERTX-four-one-two. Why aren't you atyour post? TX-four-one-two, do youcopy?A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship andwaves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicatinghis comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes hishead in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide anannoyed look.GANTRY OFFICER (CONT’D)Take over. We've got a badtransmitter. I'll see what I cando.As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealingthe towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentarystate of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chillinghowl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow.The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blastedby Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and therobots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressedas a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.74.LUKEYou know, between his howling andyour blasting everything in sight,it's a wonder the whole stationdoesn't know we're here.HANBring them on! I prefer a straightfight to all this sneaking around.THREEPIOWe found the computer outlet, sir.Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map ofthe city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect itcarefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.BENPlug in. He should be able tointerpret the entire Imperialcomputer network.Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and thevast Imperial brain network comes to life, feedinginformation to the little robot. After a few moments, hebeeps something.THREEPIOHe says he's found the maincomputer to power the tractor beamthat's holding the ship here. He'lltry to make the precise locationappear on the monitor.The computer monitor flashes readouts.THREEPIO (CONT’D)The tractor beam is coupled to themain reactor in seven locations. Apower loss at one of the terminalswill allow the ship to leave.Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.BENI don't think you boys can help. Imust go alone.HANWhatever you say. I've done morethat I bargained for on this tripalready.75.LUKEI want to go with you.BENBe patient, Luke. Stay and watchover the droids.LUKEBut he can...BENThey must be delivered safely orother star systems will suffer thesame fate as Alderaan. Your destinylies along a different path thanmine. The Force will be with you...always!Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently stepsout of the command office, then disappears down a long greyhallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his headin agreement.HANBoy you said it, Chewie.Han looks at Luke.HAN (CONT’D)Where did you dig up that oldfossil?LUKEBen is a great man.HANYeah, great at getting us intotrouble.LUKEI didn't hear you give any ideas...HANWell, anything would be better thanjust hanging around waiting for himto pick us up...LUKEWho do you think...Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.Luke goes over to him.76.LUKE (CONT’D)What is it?THREEPIOI'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.He says "I found her", and keepsrepeating, "She's here."LUKEWell, who... who has he found?Artoo whistles a frantic reply.THREEPIOPrincess Leia.LUKEThe princess? She's here?HANPrincess? What's going on?THREEPIOLevel five. Detention block A Atwenty- three. I'm afraid she'sscheduled to be terminated.LUKEOh, no!

The old man wants us to waitright here.LUKEBut he didn't know she was here.Look, will you just find a way backinto the detention block?HANI'm not going anywhere.77.LUKEThey're going to execute her. Look,a few minutes ago you said youdidn't want to just wait here to becaptured. Now all you want to do isstay.HANMarching into the detention area isnot what I had in mind.LUKEBut they're going to kill her!HANBetter her than me...LUKEShe's rich.Chewbacca growls.HANRich?LUKEYes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if youwere to rescue her, the rewardwould be...HANWhat?LUKEWell more wealth that you canimagine.HANI don't know, I can imagine quite abit!LUKEYou'll get it!HANI better!LUKEYou will...HANAll right, kid. But you'd better beright about this.78.Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.LUKEAll right.HANWhat's your plan?LUKEUh... Threepio, hand me thosebinders there will you?Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.LUKE (CONT’D)Okay. Now, I'm going to put theseon you.Chewie lets out a hideous growl.LUKE (CONT’D)Okay. Han, you put these on.Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.HANDon't worry, Chewie. I think I knowwhat he has in mind.The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face asHan binds him with the electronic cuffs.THREEPIOMaster Luke, sir! Pardon me forasking... but, ah... what shouldArtoo and I do if we're discoveredhere?LUKELock the door!HANAnd hope they don't have blasters.THREEPIOThat isn't very reassuring.Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets andstart off into the giant Imperial Death Star.107 INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE 107Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armoredsuits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive.79.Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring thetrio completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curiousglance.Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.LUKEI can't see a thing in this helmet.A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled awayby Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed andthe elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.108 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY 108Several Imperial officers walk through the wide mainpassageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robotsimilar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far endof the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, thendisappears down a small hallway. His appearance is sofleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just anillusion. No one in the hallway seems to notice him.109 INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY109AREALuke and Han step forward to exitthe elevator, but the door slidesopen behind them. The giant Wookieeand his two guards enter the oldgrey security station. Guards andlaser gates are everywhere.

A tall, grim looking Officer approachesthe trio.OFFICERWhere are you taking this... thing?Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shutup.80.LUKEPrisoner transfer from Block oneone- three-eight.OFFICERI wasn't notified. I'll have toclear it.The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch inthe information. There are only three other troopers in thearea. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of thealarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one ofChewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with oneof his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.HANLook out! He's loose!LUKEHe's going to pull us all apart.HANGo get him!The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke andHan have already pulled out their laser pistols and areblasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage oflaserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, lasergate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is thelast of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he isabout to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlinksystem, which is screeching questions about what is goingon. He quickly checks the computer readout.HAN (CONT’D)We've got to find out which cellthis princess of yours is in. Hereit is... cell twenty-one-eightseven. You go get her. I'll holdthem here.Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks intothe buzzing comlink.HAN (CONT’D)(sounding official)Everything is under control.Situation normal.INTERCOM VOICEWhat happened?81.HAN(getting nervous)Uh... had a slight weaponsmalfunction.

Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty andstands staring at her with his mouth hanging open.LEIA(finally)Aren't you a little short to be astormtrooper?Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.LUKEWhat?

They turn and run down the cell hallway, meetingup with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.HAN (CONT’D)Can't get out that way.LEIALooks like you managed to cut offour only escape route.HAN(sarcastically)Maybe you'd like it back in yourcell, Your Highness.Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as theycontinue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making theirway down the corridor.LUKESee-Threepio!

When you camein here, didn't you have a plan forgetting out?HAN(pointing to Luke)He's the brains, sweetheart.Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.85.LUKEWell, I didn't...The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate inthe wall next to Han, almost frying him.HANWhat the hell are you doing?LEIASomebody has to save our skins.Into the garbage chute, wise guy.She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbaccalook on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute andsays something.HANGet in there you big furry oaf! Idon't care what you smell! Get inthere and don't worry about it.Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into thetiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they worktheir way toward the opening.HAN (CONT’D)Wonderful girl! Either I'm going tokill her or I'm beginning to likeher. Get in there!Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Hanfires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover,then slides into the chute himself and is gone.116 INT.

Get away from there...LUKENo! wait!Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch.
